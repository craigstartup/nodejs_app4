[00:00:14] Craig Swanson | This is Growth Marketing Clinic with Jim Hoffman. I'm gonna introduce Jim in a in a moment here, but I wanna just kinda like first do a little bit of, introduction orientation. So this is before we can get started, so this this is a monthly EO education

[00:00:31] Craig Swanson | program, and we've been partnering with the Columbia Tower Club for this location. So one of the things

[00:00:31] Craig Swanson | we're looking for is also feedback on how this space is working. And how we can use it because we are looking at building this out. So we're gonna have new education stuff here in these, like, 3 hour little mini workshops every month going forward, probably to the end, probably till, like, June. Your feedback would be great. And I'm really pulling from, within our EO community, pulling in experts that teach a lot of different deep areas.

[00:01:01] Craig Swanson | Jim, well, I'll get to Jim in a bit. Before you start, I just want a quick raise of hands to see who's here so for EO. You're right. Nathan's here. If you are so for EO members, who are who are who are the big flagship EO members here?

[00:01:15] Craig Swanson | Just raise your hand. Just wanna kinda see where I'm headed. Yep. Flagship EO. Because because we've got EO Accelerator, which is up and coming EO members.

[00:01:37] Craig Swanson | So I don't know if you are introduced to you. If you're looking at, like, kinda seeing what EO or EO accelerators like, I'll just quickly kinda positioning it. It's a it's a worldwide community. And EO, big EO, is for entrepreneurs that are running businesses that are doing over a $1,000,000 a year. And EO Accelerator is an education program and community for accelerate for, for business owners that are doing over 250.

[00:02:02] Craig Swanson | And have not yet broken that $1,000,000 a year. So it's for people that want the education support and, leadership to basically get over that $1,000,000 a year so they can join EO and, like, be part of big EO. And then we also have SAP. So who's an SAP in the room? Got 3.

[00:02:18] Craig Swanson | Alright. Fantastic. So I wanna, 1st of all, give a big thank you to our SAPs. SAPs, our our supporting EO. They basically are members that really give us a lot of help.

[00:02:30] Craig Swanson | And John, can you I just wanna give, our our SAPs just like 60 seconds each to kind of introduce each themselves.

James Albertson, certainly, training, and, you know, whether you continue to be frustrated because your sales team are aggressively waiting for the phone to ring, or maybe when they get opportunities, they artificially elongate the process because they don't create the value, ask the right questions, or maybe when they get deals, they get it at this expensive margin because of discounting cutting price, not doing what they're supposed to do. Sales, coaching, management coaching. Maybe we can help. Give me a call.

[00:03:06] James Alberson (Sandler Sales) | We'll see if we're a fit. James Alverson.

[00:03:55] Casey Cronk (First Security) | Craig, and everything. Thanks, Wendy.

[00:04:06] Craig Swanson | And I'll just say, for my own experience, like, when I pointed people to one day, it is, like, when they are considering an exit or have an exit coming up, the next 3 years are debating, really, really great conversation to have in KC.

[00:04:18] Jim Hoffman | Hi. I'm Casey Cronk. I'm with First Security Bank. We're a community bank, based here in Washington. Man, I have been out of town for a couple weeks, and I'm like, This is a great way to get back into the work end.

[00:04:37] Jim Hoffman | Anyway, so, couple of reasons you might wanna reach out and talk to us if you're having issues with your current bank relationship or need a creative lending solution or

[00:04:47] Craig Swanson | maybe need to get some answers quick to get a transaction done, or need some advice on how to get ready for,

[00:04:48] Jim Hoffman | some sort of lending. You know, we're really here to help and be advisors if and if we're not able to help, we know a whole network of other lenders in the area that might be a good fit for you so you don't have to keep, searching.

[00:05:39] Craig Swanson | Yep. I will in October. Cool. It'll it's it's at the hub sign up. And then did you wanna inter we were you're with him?

[00:05:48] Craig Swanson | That's what I thought. I just wanted to, like, I didn't I didn't I didn't you'd I'm with him. Alright. So There's no way you're gonna be able to use those QR code, but just kind of reminder for us about coming events for EO members. First of all, we have, I think it's next week, September 2nd, we have probably the most expensive per person event that we have done this year, probably in the last couple of years, it is we have we have, catered a balloon ride, for members, with beautiful views of Mount Rainier.

[00:06:18] Craig Swanson | I think there are still, like, six slots open. So if you're an eel member and wanna go do this, go grab it because it is We it it is a significant portion of what we're investing in this year for some really cool, like, out of the box ideas. We're gonna be back here next in September with a workshop on learning to tell your story from the front of the stage. So, basically, like, really imbuing your story into your marketing and your business, being able to basically take the stage in service of yourself and your business. Make sure you're signed up for the chapter retreat in Oregon.

[00:06:49] Craig Swanson | And then we'll be back here in November. We're skipping, October because it'll be the chapter retreat. For the predictable sales pipeline, which, honestly, some of these things program for because I had, like, five people say I really, really want you to schedule them to, like, teach this class. So Predictable sales pipeline is going to be a really great program. And, I think oh, EOA.

[00:07:07] Craig Swanson | So Accelerator, I remember I mentioned Accelerator, All EO members can audit and and take part in the Accelerate program. There are 4 learning events a year around cash, people, execution and then strategy Jennifer in the back is the head of the Accelerator program, and we have that quarterly here at the Columbia Tower Club as well. So all your members can join, and also we have a lot of people in the Accelerator program that are part of this. And there are far too many, my, you know,

[00:07:47] Craig Swanson | events coming up. These are these are events that are basically put on by members or by, by SAPs. The one thing to

[00:07:47] Craig Swanson | point out here Which one? Macron. Oh, Macron. Okay. There we go.

[00:08:00] Craig Swanson | I'm just gonna point. I'll tell you some macrons. Make macrons on September 17th. Fantastic. Alright.

[00:08:09] Craig Swanson | And I'm we're gonna do a quick job of introducing Jim Hoffman. Jim is a really good friend. It's, like, Jim is one of my favorite things I got out of joining EO. And, so Jim is the founder and CEO of Growth Hit. That is his EO qualifying business over the I don't know how many I don't know how long, but over however long he's been doing that, he has helped a 135 clients big name clients that you've heard of sell over over a quarter $1,000,000,000 in new products.

[00:08:37] Craig Swanson | So that is the credibility statement that that gives him the right to stand up here. He's also an author. He wrote the Growth Marketers Playbook that was number 1 on Amazon and was a was above Seth Godin for a couple minutes. He's also an entrepreneur himself. He has been doing

[00:08:57] Craig Swanson | a lot of, like, in public creation of businesses and just recently acquired

[00:08:57] Craig Swanson | neat, which is a t shirt company that he'll be talking about more. And, as a mentor and educator, he has done a tremendous amount of coaching in the techstars program. It's one of the reasons why I wanted to have him here. He has taught a couple things at the accelerator program. And, he's never taught this particular combination of things, but everything that we're doing here, I've seen Jim teach a dozen times over.

[00:09:21] Craig Swanson | So, Jim, thank you very much for joining us today. Oh, oh, I'm I had my one challenge, my one challenge. Sorry about this. So we were talking about this beforehand. I should warn you there's a fire hose information coming.

[00:09:33] Craig Swanson | Maybe too much. But here's the thing. What I want is my my goal is basically $1000. I want I want I just when you hit something, it could be the very first thing. It could be the 7th thing, whatever it is.

[00:09:43] Craig Swanson | You hit a $1000 of value. Just raise your hand and let me know, like, when you're there. And I wouldn't feel pressured to get everything because there's a lot here, but, basically, I'd love to know what in here hit that $1000 threshold for you. Cool. Craig.

[00:09:51] Craig Swanson | Thank you.

[00:10:00] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | How about now? See the

[00:10:03] Jim Hoffman | green light? Alright. Cool. Thank you, guys. Yeah.

[00:10:08] Jim Hoffman | Craig and the deck ahead of time. And he's like, lot. And so I I definitely understand that. So I appreciate you guys being here. So what's blocking your growth?

[00:10:22] Jim Hoffman | Right? I think a lot of I was actually telling a will about this beforehand. Like, first time founders think about product, Second time founders think about distribution and growth. We know that that is the lifeblood of business, and it is it's hard. Right?

[00:10:35] Jim Hoffman | So the goal at the end of this is hopefully walk away with some frameworks and case studies to inspire you on how to break out. So I'm wearing a blazer, guys. I came to play. I hope we we get something good out of it today, so so I'm excited. See, I corrected the really nice intro.

[00:10:51] Jim Hoffman | There's a screenshot of me above Seth Goeden to prove it. It was hours, not minutes. That's in Salt That was insulting, but that's fine. I have a podcast where I try and talk to smart founders like you all instill your secrets. Craig's been on there, like, three times because he's done some very cool things.

[00:11:08] Jim Hoffman | Yeah, and then A bunch of other stuff there. I'm a girl dad of two girls. So, yeah, I my toenails are currently pink right now, but you cannot see that. So, yeah, growth hit. What do we do?

[00:11:18] Jim Hoffman | I'll keep this simple. We grow companies. At top of the funnel, we run Oh, we optimize websites. We design websites to increase things. We'll we'll get more into this in a second.

[00:11:31] Jim Hoffman | Like Craig said, we acquired this company neat. It's sweatproof shirts. I'm wearing one right now.

[00:11:37] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | Oh, thank you. You're able to

[00:11:39] Jim Hoffman | take it off, or I'll use the 2. Alright. Cool. How's that? Is that better?

[00:11:42] Jim Hoffman | Okay. Thank you all. So, basically, there was a patent that was made for the military where you can't sweat through shirts. That company went bankrupt. And so we're able to get the IP to make it into a shirt for guys like me that that run hot.

[00:11:57] Jim Hoffman | So it's a swell resistant shirt. I I I give you this intro to it because I'm a use it in the case studies. So what I wanna share with you today is We've run 4000 growth experiments for our clients. Right? It's like ad experiments, website experiments.

[00:12:13] Jim Hoffman | And we've we've learned some things doing that. We've failed a lot, and we'll get into that as well. But my goal is to share what we've learned along the way to help you break through when you're trying to grow. So yeah, we we've had a quarter billion in sales running experiments. I wish I could act like I get credit for all this, but it's a cool number to throw up there.

[00:12:30] Jim Hoffman | So we'll just act like that's the truth. So we optimize websites. We run as we run content. You kinda get the the gist of this. We we've sold some crazy things.

[00:12:42] Jim Hoffman | Wedding dresses, jammies for pit bulls, CFO advisory services, HVAC services, caffeinated chocolates. And so

[00:12:50] Craig Swanson | for me, it's really fun to go into

[00:12:50] Jim Hoffman | a different business model from enterprise to consumer and really try and uncover what's blocking growth? What are the unit economics? How do we pull this off? So those slides are great. Look how smart I am.

[00:13:05] Jim Hoffman | Right? Doesn't look like I know everything. I'm a complete failure. I have made so many mistakes in trying to grow. Our win rate is 33%.

[00:13:14] Jim Hoffman | That means I fail a lot. Right? Over 60 percent of stuff we put out there is flat or it's declining. And you can't see it, but I because I put a nice little gray area over this. These are my failed startups that I have launched that we're gonna change the world and they are now just domains in my GoDaddy account.

[00:13:31] Jim Hoffman | And so I say this and that it really is about this iterative approach that I wanna kinda put in you all today. Okay. Wasn't that a nice motivational part of the speech? Okay. Let's talk about you all, what you're gonna get out of today.

[00:13:44] Jim Hoffman | So why you're here. Right? Let's uncover what's blocking growth. And so I think there's 3 core components of this that we're really gonna dissect. The second component is how do we unblock growth?

[00:13:57] Jim Hoffman | Right? Like, okay, I've diagnosed the problem. What next? And then finally, I'm a big kind of fan of systems and frameworks. That's like my love language and business.

[00:14:09] Jim Hoffman | So I I wanna kinda give that to you guys. Alright. This is the sales slide. I apologize in advance. I hate these talks.

[00:14:15] Jim Hoffman | When at the very end, there's a big, like, green buy button, that is not the goal for this. But to give full context, We're working on what we're calling the gross marketing operating system. It's inspired by EOS interaction. So raise of hands who here runs EOS at their company. Okay.

[00:14:26] Jim Hoffman | A lot of people awesome. So that's the entrepreneur operating system. It's from the book traction. It's basically a frameworks around your company. I'm obsessed with it.

[00:14:39] Jim Hoffman | I I think for me, it was just lacking in marketing and growth. I was like, I want this, but just for marketing. So that's the goal for it. We're doing a bigger launch, where we're gonna try and make it really expensive. But, by the way, I'm giving you, like, 80% of it today, so you don't need to go buy the thing.

[00:14:55] Jim Hoffman | But if you want it, there you go. So that was a sales part of it. So we're we're done with that. Wasn't that fun? Okay.

[00:15:02] Jim Hoffman | The other thing, just to give you, like, I told you I, like, frameworks and systems, this is what we're gonna cover today. So when Craig said there's a lot, I think he was mentioning this. I learned the best through case studies and examples. So for me, that's the stickiest way to learn. So what I think you'll like about today is I'm gonna, as Craig said, fire hose you with case studies, hoping that some of that sticks, I'm gonna give you frameworks so you can take that to your team and incorporate it.

[00:15:29] Jim Hoffman | And we're gonna do exercises so you can get inspired from other CEOs, I think, is the right word to use. And then zero selling after the slide I did 2 slides ago. Okay. And then the other thing, since this is EO, it's about vulnerability and it's about honesty, I'm gonna show you what I'm trying to do with my companies where it's working and where it's, failing. Just so you can, get a feel for that.

[00:15:52] Jim Hoffman | Alright. Here's my pump up slide. This is not a spot. It's a gym. You you get out what you put in.

[00:16:00] Jim Hoffman | So I'm happy to be up here and entertain I will not have any good Jay at jokes. It'll probably be lame, but these exercises, I'd say put something into, and I think it'll be helpful. Okay. So here we go. Phase 1.

[00:16:12] Jim Hoffman | What's blocking your growth? So you might be thinking like, wait. Do do I have a growth problem? Like, am I really struggling? I have some some bad news for you, and it's something that

[00:16:18] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | that I know just from the stats and the data.

[00:16:28] Craig Swanson | So here we go. Fewer than 5% of all businesses in the US grow to over a 1,000,000 a year in revenue. So guys, we're in the top 5%.

[00:16:29] Jim Hoffman | Isn't that amazing? But then to get to the the 10,000,000 mark, it's fewer than 1%. So so what does that mean? How do we extrapolate that a little bit more? What it means is of the 28,000,000 companies that are out there according to Gazell's, there are some valleys of death where we launch a

[00:16:55] Craig Swanson | business and we go to just hang out for quite a long time. Right? I think the average

[00:16:56] Jim Hoffman | life of a company is 5 years. So where are most of us living right now? We're down here in in this little valley. And, there's this really, really good book. I'd recommend you to read, simple number straight talk, big profits, and it talks about the black hole of business where most companies go and kinda stop.

[00:17:19] Jim Hoffman | Right? A natural no man's land of private businesses between 1 to 5,000,000. So let's ask ourselves, are we in that black hole right now? So some some signs you might be in denial, but you're actually in the black hole right now. Okay.

[00:17:25] Jim Hoffman | So first, are you selling a product or service where you're competing on price? Right? That's, as we know, a race to a bottom. Or second, are you trying to scale and you're sending traffic to a site that doesn't convert? It's not working.

[00:17:49] Jim Hoffman | It's like, I guess I'll just keep getting referrals. Or finally, you're getting small wins from 1 off

[00:17:55] Craig Swanson | tactics, but it's not predictable, and it's not scalable. Right? So so what does that mean? We are living in a world

[00:17:55] Jim Hoffman | of volatile and unpredictable growth. Like, One quick question. Raise your hand if you have a b to b company, business to business? Okay. Great.

[00:18:11] Jim Hoffman | And then raise your hand for b to c companies. Okay. Nice. Yeah. Because, like, with b to b companies, if you're service based, it's like, oh, my gosh, we're crushing it.

[00:18:20] Jim Hoffman | We need to hire up. And then 2 months later, you're like, oh, my gosh. We're gonna have to lay people off. Where's the next deal coming from? And on the consumer side, it's like you're living on the Facebook algorithm sometimes.

[00:18:30] Jim Hoffman | So the question is is we're we're in this whole, this this valley of death what what are we doing about it? Well, if you're like me, you've been guilty of some of the these mistakes. Right? You see this problem, like clients are churning, you're like and turn up the Google ad spend. Let's go.

[00:18:45] Jim Hoffman | Or man, our our margins are sliding. Like, what's the problem? It's like, have we tried cold email? Have we used an AI bot to do that? Let's go for it.

[00:18:55] Jim Hoffman | Or worse, you you kinda know what you should be focused on. I need to talk to customers, get to the root of this, but Now let's just go viral and tiktok. So how do we go from this world of survival

[00:19:05] Craig Swanson | mode, volatility to scaling? So I I I hope I have the answer

[00:19:05] Jim Hoffman | for you today, but it's gonna be really boring and underwhelming. I I really think it's about a system, building into your culture

[00:19:17] Craig Swanson | and your DNA a system of testing and learning and growth. And so this is what we're gonna cover today.

[00:19:18] Jim Hoffman | And I'm gonna keep it very simple. 1st, North Star, do you know what's blocking growth and are you focused on it? Like, I'm a huge fan of the one metric that matters framework from the Book lean analytics. So once you know what to focus on, do you have the right strategy and plan to go after it? And then this is where we fall apart.

[00:19:44] Jim Hoffman | Do we even know how to run a team or an organization that can do that? Cause as we've seen companies go from, like, a round, b

[00:19:51] Craig Swanson | round of funding, or go from 6 figures to

[00:19:51] Jim Hoffman | 7 figures or 7 figures to 8 figures, we see these common traits. That's really impressive. So, let's talk about where to begin as we wanna unblock growth. So I have a executive coach, Frick Maguire, where I'll have a problem with my company. And I'm like, hold my beer.

[00:20:12] Jim Hoffman | I know the solution. I jump in

[00:20:12] Craig Swanson | to solve it. And then he's like, stop being Superman. You need to understand

[00:20:13] Jim Hoffman | the context. Understand how the problem works before you start solving it. And and I love that thought. So if if we're blocked with growth right now, let's try and diagnose what that problem is. So this this graphic that I did not design, my designer did, I wish you could take credit.

[00:20:34] Jim Hoffman | There's three things in my mind. Right? So it's positioning, it's conversion and it's traffic. And so the question is, what's the number one thing

[00:20:43] Craig Swanson | right now that's holding you back from going to mid 7 figures to 8 figures or to hitting that 7 figure milestone?

[00:20:44] Jim Hoffman | And by the way, if you try and grow before you have those things dialed in, it's a really quick accelerant to fail. I I know from experience, there's been some people that have really wanted to work with us. We took them on, and they had a product market fit problem. They had some real issues where they weren't ready to scale. Okay.

[00:21:11] Jim Hoffman | So what what I wanna begin with is what I'm calling the scalability assessment. So in these nice little handouts, you have, if you go through it, I want you to find the scalability assessment. And I want you to fill this out. So go through the questions, and then if you're doing really well, you put a 3. If it's kinda middle of the road, you put a 2, and if it's not going well, it's a 1.

[00:21:34] Jim Hoffman | And so you'll fill this out based on positioning, traffic and conversion. So I wanna take a few minutes, and then I wanna have you guys compare notes with with your group. So I'll give you guys a few minutes to fill that out. Alright. So if as you guys finish up, I'd love for you to compare notes with people at your table as far as where's the biggest blocker right now out of those categories.

[00:22:02] Jim Hoffman | Just let we'd love for you guys to kinda figure out what that main thing is. Alright. Cool. I'd love, if you guys are open to

[00:22:05] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | it,

[00:22:14] Jim Hoffman | Would you be willing to share as far as what what we're

[00:22:17] Craig Swanson | thinking or feeling on this? So let's start with,

[00:22:17] Jim Hoffman | positioning. Who who's struggling with positioning right now? Awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:22:30] Craig Swanson | So when I say positioning, you're 3, 4, 5.

[00:22:30] Jim Hoffman | Is that where you guys are? Hi. Cool. Not to put you on the hot seat, but this is the hot seat section. Anybody wanna share with us, like, what they think they're struggling with with positioning?

[00:22:49] Jim Hoffman | I'm gravitating towards you guys.

[00:22:51] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | Oh, yeah. Awesome. Beautiful. Thank you.

[00:22:53] Jim Hoffman | You got lucky.

[00:22:53] Craig Swanson | I'll take them out.

[00:22:54] Jim Hoffman | Thanks. Right? Who's who's going to?

[00:22:55] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | I will.

[00:22:56] Casey Cronk (First Security) | Yeah. I think one thing with positioning for my company, I know that we provide a valuable service, but I'm having such a hard time really getting the client to understand, like, everything that we can do for them. And that just continues to be a constant, like, struggle. And then also, like, we are having a lot of leads come in, but they're not really our target, client of who we're really looking to serve. And that's partially because we've niched down over time, and then people know, hey.

[00:23:24] Casey Cronk (First Security) | You need a fractional CFO. Go talk to them. So we have a lot of volume of leads. Just not tailored to what who we really wanna serve.

[00:23:33] Jim Hoffman | So your traffic score might have been good. It sounds like Congratulations. But on the positioning, it's like the clients don't understand what you do. What language do they speak? Like, when they come in, is it for a a certain problem, or is it for like a flagship product?

[00:23:50] Jim Hoffman | Where they only see you in in in that light or any color on that?

[00:23:55] Casey Cronk (First Security) | What language they speak? Maybe they've had people tell. It's not really product based. It's more like hey, we know we need to kind of uplevel in this area, and we've been told that maybe we need a higher fractional CFO, or we're having these general problems. So we're coming to you to see if you're the right fit.

[00:24:15] Casey Cronk (First Security) | But I think there's also a lot of competition in this space now that is maybe lower cost. So then they're not really seeing, like, why they would pay more for our services, maybe versus somebody who's saying they're providing CFO services. So

[00:24:30] Jim Hoffman | So that it sounds like they're a little oblivious rather than educated. And if they don't understand the quality and value, you're competing on price is a potential problem. Which we don't wanna do. Okay. Cool.

[00:24:42] Jim Hoffman | That that that's super helpful. We have a a few things coming up that that I think will help. Anybody else on the positioning where where you're struggling.

[00:24:52] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | So even after we're done, you wanna our customer's still don't know what they did. We're just glad they did it.

[00:24:59] Jim Hoffman | Wait. Say it. Wait. After you're done.

[00:25:01] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | After we're done, they still will tell you. We don't know what they did, but we're just glad they did it.

[00:25:08] Jim Hoffman | And what was what product or service you have?

[00:25:10] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | We provide project management services. Gotcha.

[00:25:13] Jim Hoffman | So you're not getting credit for the value that's being delivered?

[00:25:18] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | Correct. Gotcha. They can't articulate it. They love that we were there. And they'll wreck it.

[00:25:25] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | Our whole sales process has still been word-of-mouth referral. Because it's So,

[00:25:32] Craig Swanson | in their words, can you go deeper on that magic moment? And to give you to lead the witness a

[00:25:32] Jim Hoffman | little bit, Are you winning on time, money, experience, or some sort of pain relief? Pain relief. Okay. And what was the pain that was there that has gone away? Usually, it's a big big problem.

[00:25:55] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | An M and A integration, something like that.

[00:25:57] Jim Hoffman | So I acquired a company. You acquired a large company.

[00:26:00] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | You've spent a year trying to get it in in integrated. Mhmm. You've got 6 months left, and now you call us.

[00:26:09] Craig Swanson | Mhmm.

[00:26:09] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | Because it hurts and you know you're gonna hit a a wall. Mhmm.

[00:26:13] Jim Hoffman | So Yeah.

[00:26:15] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | And you heard of us because you asked a friend who was in the same spot 2 years ago.

[00:26:19] Jim Hoffman | Mhmm. So in correlating this to the traffic, you are not You're only getting referrals. So you're saying you're not able to articulate that point pain you're solving to find a new lead source for getting business. Is that correct?

[00:26:35] Paul Thompson (Project Management Services) | It is it is very difficult for us to articulate that Pain relief, in a way that resonates with somebody at the beginning of their journey rather than after they've stepped on the the landmine a couple of times.

[00:26:51] Jim Hoffman | Thank you. And 13 slides, I have something for you. Thank you. Alright.

[00:26:54] Craig Swanson | Let's go down.

[00:26:54] Jim Hoffman | Oh, wait. Sorry. One more.

[00:26:54] Craig Swanson | I'll Yep.

[00:26:54] Jim Hoffman | There's one oh, okay.

[00:27:07] Shirin Sarikhani (Seattle Staged to Sell) | It's hard for us to articulate and message.

[00:27:12] Jim Hoffman | Sir, will you say your business and what you do so everyone knows?

[00:27:15] Shirin Sarikhani (Seattle Staged to Sell) | Yes. Seattle stage to sales of your home staging company. We have been in business for 19 years. And from day 1, we I made it the company that we create a lifestyle.

[00:27:27] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | We tell we tell a story through design, and it's so hard to articulate that.

[00:27:27] Shirin Sarikhani (Seattle Staged to Sell) | The value we bring every home is stage uniquely differently based on the targeted buyers and the home, whereas others, they don't do that. And it's such a hard thing to articulate. So, basically, if you have 5 minutes, you can sell the dream and whim tool.

[00:27:52] Jim Hoffman | But To put it in an ad, it's hard to convey that. Is that correct? Okay. I I totally hear you. I think same with the CFO side.

[00:28:01] Jim Hoffman | It's like, give me a slide deck in 30 minutes. You'll you'll win their hearts and minds, but it's tough to distill it down. Okay. Thank you. I have something for you too.

[00:28:09] Jim Hoffman | I promise. Derek.

[00:28:09] Craig Swanson | Derek Calis, our business

[00:28:09] Jim Hoffman | is cybersecurity. And one part of

[00:28:19] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | this had jumped out at me. It was number 3 on the must have product, and it almost, a place where we struggle on a values perspective is doing incident response, which is the you you're something bad has happened. You're afraid. And there's, a saying in our business called, but fear uncertainty and doubt. And I'm sitting here listening and wondering if we should be thinking more about positioning with that with that stream of emotion because it's so powerful even though our business has made you know, a conscientious choice to not use FUD to help us in

[00:28:53] Craig Swanson | that that space of our business. So I don't know if you've got a slide for that, but that's definitely on my mind

[00:28:54] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | positioning wise because it feels You know, that moment with that co when that situation is happening with a with a customer, it's about as vulnerable as you can get when you're looking somebody in the eyes and they're worried their business is gonna go away tomorrow. So

[00:29:15] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. We talk about pouring the salt in the wound, whenever we're doing a copy.

[00:29:19] Craig Swanson | And another thing to think about is what is that salt in the wound problem that can be

[00:29:19] Jim Hoffman | your tip of the spear, your flagship product, that once you're in, then you have other suites of services and products you can get into, but doing it in a way where it makes sense for the brand and how you're thinking about it. But also like a point of differentiation, like other people probably solve that problem, but then it's like, how you solve it by segment or differently. So, yeah. Okay. Cool.

[00:29:48] Jim Hoffman | Let's go to traffic. Raise your hand if you scored low on traffic, right, under, like, a 5 or 6. Okay. Nice. Anyone wanna share their traffic problems.

[00:29:59] Jim Hoffman | And this is the trust tree. So this is all confidential, I think. We might be live streaming it, but that's okay. And if I wanna share their traffic problems, Will Rush, everybody.

[00:30:11] Will Rush (jetson.app) | What's going on, guys? So our our business is a mobile app, that helps automate the 0 to 1 of starting a business. And, I think a big part of our traffic problem, we have a community that is, probably drives 80 to 90 percent of our growth. And that community is extremely high converting and really, really high quality traffic. But at the same time, it requires a lot of time and resources to actually put on that community.

[00:30:39] Will Rush (jetson.app) | And so I think we're always asking ourselves the question of how do we create other streams of growth, that obviously scale much quicker and much faster in the tech world.

[00:30:52] Jim Hoffman | So, basically, he's found his early adopters. It's working, but it's like crap. How do I get the fast followers? How do I get the masses in in another channel, whether it's paid or free, it works for the unit economics. So you've kinda hit a wall.

[00:31:07] Jim Hoffman | It's like we've got the early adopters. How do we break through? It's kinda what I'm hearing. Anybody else having that issue, or you guys all have that solved? Okay.

[00:31:15] Jim Hoffman | Awesome. Let me go for By the way, Will, I have a slide for you. I promise.

[00:31:18] Charlie Hersman (IT Assurance) | Yeah. We don't have it solved. So sorry.

[00:31:23] Michael Huynh (Macadons) | No. So And I'm sorry.

[00:31:24] Jim Hoffman | We say your business.

[00:31:25] Charlie Hersman (IT Assurance) | Oh, sorry. I'm IT Assurance. We are our business managed IT support out of Portland. So one of our challenges is is that I'm actually coming in as a a new owner, and we have somebody who built the entire business on their own personal referrals and personal relationships. I'm also coming from operations So learning how to do this and learning how to do it with no network.

[00:31:50] Charlie Hersman (IT Assurance) | And there's a bit of with with traffic, what does that spin up look like? Can I do it fast enough that we can survive, how do we compete? When I'm starting with with 0 network at all. So that's been, a big part of March traffic has been we've realized so heavily on referrals, and I don't I don't have much of a network yet.

[00:32:11] Jim Hoffman | So, basically, the the past business model, I call it founder led growth. When it's based on the founder, their network and referrals, you take that away.

[00:32:19] Craig Swanson | What's your other go

[00:32:19] Jim Hoffman | to market strategy? We're actually gonna go through 8 go to market strategy approaches. Because anyone here interested in acquisition entrepreneurship buying a company and then doing exciting things with it, this is one issue that happens, right, because there's so much ingrained in the founder how you can you can break through. So we'll we'll we'll definitely get into that. What about conversion?

[00:32:43] Jim Hoffman | Anybody you wanna get on the therapy couch and talk about their conversion problems? Oh, go for it. Are you Craig's out of bed, Mike?

[00:32:53] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | So I'm also with Seattle Sage Cassel with Sharon. I have a slightly different opinion though than you. I don't I don't

[00:33:02] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | think our problem is positioning.

[00:33:04] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | I feel like We do a decent job of being able to share what our value is. I think the problem is more the conversion of Especially because the housing our business is entirely tied to the housing market. So the housing market is down because interest rates are high. So

[00:33:32] Craig Swanson | price is such a huge deal. And to be able to provide what makes us unique and special, and that extra value is expensive.

[00:33:33] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | So therefore, we're not the cheapest home staging company. So when houses are not selling for as much, people wanna go for that

[00:33:52] Craig Swanson | cheaper price, as well as a lot of our competitors. I feel

[00:33:53] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | like they steal a lot of the positioning that we do. And like, take some of our phrases and use it

[00:34:04] Craig Swanson | as our own, even though they don't actually provide that same value.

[00:34:04] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | So homeowners who don't know just go with the price. So I've I feel like that's our issue.

[00:34:18] Jim Hoffman | The the uninformed

[00:34:19] Craig Swanson | buyer that doesn't appreciate or understand the value and quality, view you as a commodity, and so you're competing

[00:34:20] Jim Hoffman | on price is what I'm

[00:34:23] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | hearing.

[00:34:28] Jim Hoffman | So, I there's a a slide coming up in the conversion section where the so there are there are only seven reasons why people are not converting on your website and value is a big one of them. So we'll talk about that and and and how to address it. But you're not alone. I I've been trying to raise my prices for a long time, and that's that can be an issue. Anything else on position?

[00:34:47] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. See you. Alright. Thanks. You know, I don't

[00:34:55] Steve Wangen (IBS Treatment Center) | I I this is really interesting. I think looking at the position conversion and traffic, and I don't trust myself to really know if I am a value self assessment is really accurate, right, on this. Steve Weng and IBS treatment center, I specialize in treating neuro bowel syndrome. But so I I look at it, and I think conversion is my worst, but I've been focused a lot on positioning, and I kinda wonder really where is am am I assessing this? Well,

[00:35:23] Jim Hoffman | That's really good feedback. And I think for traffic and conversion, we could actually quantify that

[00:35:28] Craig Swanson | and and and tell you based on benchmarks, on the conversion side, retention side,

[00:35:28] Jim Hoffman | on the traffic side from a growth rate and a traffic quality perspective, we can get into it. The one that's a little warm and fuzzy is positioning. That is one that I think is probably the hardest one to to, quantify. It's a little bit more qualitative. But, but I hear you there because I think the other 2, we could kinda nerd out on some ways to go down that that we'll hit on when we get into unit economics.

[00:35:59] Jim Hoffman | We will be doing math, so get excited. The position one is is the harder one. Okay. And any other final comment? Yeah.

[00:36:07] Jim Hoffman | Go for it. So

[00:36:12] Liz Philpot (Eat Seattle Tours) | I have an interesting one to add. So we compete less with our competitors. Eat Seattle tours. We do chef guided food tours of Pikeley's market in South Lake Union, and we compete more with our third parties like Viator who resell our tickets for 24% commission. And we are now trying to differentiate ourselves, subtly, to get that business direct because it makes a really big difference.

[00:36:42] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. That that sorry. That that's a good one. I compare it to, some e commerce products that sell on different platforms. Well, we'll be very selective on products we put on Amazon versus the core product.

[00:36:54] Jim Hoffman | Like, There could be a a flagship, acquisition product on Amazon, but the more, like, bundle luxury experience could come through you. I don't there might be issues,

[00:37:04] Craig Swanson | differentiating the pros, the product. But if there's

[00:37:04] Jim Hoffman | a way to have a more premium or something with something added, some little nuance could could be helpful there. But, that's definitely, one that one we could think through. I'm trying to think if that fits more into positioning or conversion. It's a little bit of both, but we can get into that. Thank you.

[00:37:26] Jim Hoffman | Alright. Yeah. Go for it. And say

[00:37:28] Craig Swanson | your business, please. I'm Brooke. I'm here with experience momentum. We are an integrated wellness center that offers

[00:37:28] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | physical therapy and massage nutrition and fitness.

[00:37:40] Brooke Benedict (Experience Momentum) | So we're a little unique with our

[00:37:42] Craig Swanson | conversion that traffic coming to our website actually mostly just generates leads. The conversion actually happens when they walk

[00:37:42] Brooke Benedict (Experience Momentum) | through our doors. And so that is where we struggle. Also communicating all that we offer, in those moments,

[00:37:55] Craig Swanson | but it kinda turns into actually like sales at that point and having our, customer facing

[00:37:55] Brooke Benedict (Experience Momentum) | staff being able to do the conversion process, and capitalize on those leads and people who are already somewhat invested and then walked through. So that's kind of where we've been struggling. So rather than a

[00:38:21] Jim Hoffman | online conversion, it's an offline conversion, right, understanding what that process and and system is. And I'm sure I assume there are incentives that align with how they're converting and closing. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah.

[00:38:38] Jim Hoffman | Gotcha. I'm a big fan of Charlie Munker quote. Right? Show me the incentive. I'll I'll show you the actions.

[00:38:43] Jim Hoffman | I I'm thinking through that. I'm thinking through, some of the the packaging and positioning we could probably get into on commercial on that, but that's definitely a That's a good example, actually. Thank you. Alright. Anybody else with issues they're struggling with, they wanna hit on before we go to the first section?

[00:38:59] Jim Hoffman | By the way, what do you guys think of that exercise? I'd love your feedback. If it's good, you can blur it out. If it's really negative, you can send me a DM, But any thoughts on the scoring? Was that opening your eyes to, like, where to focus?

[00:39:13] Jim Hoffman | Okay. I'm at. Yeah. Go for it. Several founders that thought there was anything was quite good.

[00:39:25] Jim Hoffman | It may be

[00:39:25] Craig Swanson | interesting to see employees where where, you know, where they, but based on customer interaction, that's gonna be. So my hypothesis is that founders have

[00:39:26] Jim Hoffman | a higher view of their company's vision. Maybe because it's more so in their head and how they articulated, and there's a lot of yes men around them. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.

[00:39:50] Craig Swanson | That's hilarious.

[00:40:01] Jim Hoffman | Right. Okay. Alright. Thank you guys for that. So we're gonna get to the first section.

[00:40:07] Jim Hoffman | First off, how are we doing? Do we need a break? How are we doing? Keep going? Okay.

[00:40:13] Jim Hoffman | Alright. So positioning. This is my beautiful Photoshop work if you can't tell with the big arrows. So let's get into positioning. We hit on the questions here, like, how to know if you have an issue.

[00:40:24] Jim Hoffman | 1, do you get new customers because of your point of differentiation? 2, this one's big. Can your customers clearly articulate your value prop? If they're to Bar, if they're talking to a colleague, what are the 7 words they will say? To describe your product or service?

[00:40:39] Jim Hoffman | And is it what you want? And then are you a must have, not a nice have? When I go through a potential prospect and it's another commoditized product, I'm like, crap. This is gonna be hard. I I really wanna have that, that must have with that point of differentiation.

[00:40:54] Jim Hoffman | And then bonus points, if you have true

[00:40:55] Craig Swanson | urgency or scarcity, your your score will go up. So, for those of you that maybe scored below a 5 or

[00:40:55] Jim Hoffman | a 6, This one's gonna sting. I apologize for the slide. This is what this means. No one cares. Right?

[00:41:13] Jim Hoffman | And by the way, I'm thinking my mom can explain some of the things I work on. So I I have my own positioning issues. So That's the problem. No one cares about our product. So how do we break through?

[00:41:23] Jim Hoffman | How do we unblock? So these are the two things that will be your cheat code to unblock. Simply put, do you know why customers should care? I'm gonna give you the framework to do that. Then second, this one's so important Do you know the language your customers speak to resonate?

[00:41:38] Jim Hoffman | 3 customers you need to to talk to. Alright. So let's dive in. 1, here we go. Why your customers should care?

[00:41:45] Jim Hoffman | So I've done this exercise like a 100 plus companies This will be the most painful exercise you do. I apologize. But it's so fruitful. And I wanna call it a few key things. This is how you can be black belt at this.

[00:41:58] Jim Hoffman | First, your target customer The more specific, the better. Feel free to go a little uncomfortable. Are you going to a niche? That's okay. The second thing, do you really understand their need and the benefit payoff?

[00:42:11] Jim Hoffman | There needs to be a connect here. Alright. So that's one call out. And then this is the most important. Draw a line in the sand right now.

[00:42:19] Jim Hoffman | Who are you competing with and why are you better? And by the way, a lot of times, you're not competing with a direct competitor, right, you're competing with status quo. You're competing with indifference.

[00:42:31] Craig Swanson | You're competing with a whole industry segment. And by the

[00:42:31] Jim Hoffman | way, when I'm competing, I would much rather villainize a category than a company, especially if they have a low NPS score, or if it's something that everybody hates on, right, like the DMV. Let me compete with the DMV all day long. I don't wanna compete with Apple. Like, the the brand affinity is amazing. Okay.

[00:42:53] Jim Hoffman | So I'm gonna show this in action with our our brand neat, and what we do. So we go after, dudes, 25 to 60, have hyperhidrosis,

[00:43:01] Craig Swanson | run hot that sweat. The benefit that's that's the problem. The payoff

[00:43:02] Jim Hoffman | is we help prevent sweat. Who are we competing against? I'm not competing against Thompson Ts and, like, sweat wicking brands. I'm going after regular t shirts. I'm going after your cotton shirt that you wear at a presentation.

[00:43:23] Jim Hoffman | You can't wear Heather gray because you're gonna sweat through it. You can now with meat. And we do it with our IP that was made for the military. So notice I'm going after a category there. And so this should be very easy, to understand why people should care.

[00:43:38] Jim Hoffman | Cause I know the persona I know the benefit and what we're competing against. And when you're competing, you you want it to be not a 10% gain, but like a 10 x gain if you can. I know that's hard. So just wanna call that out. So is you're doing this exercise, kinda put those thoughts down on why people should care.

[00:43:58] Jim Hoffman | Okay. So that's step 1, why people should care. Now here's the second thing, and this is where we get lost. It's how do we speak to customers? What language are we using?

[00:44:09] Jim Hoffman | So, this is one of my favorite, reads I've had around Derek Halpern. He he kinda goes into this, and I've it's something we've kind of morphed on, but let's just talk about 3 personas. Well, so about your early adopters? These people are informed. What does that mean?

[00:44:26] Jim Hoffman | So I have a a growth marketing agency. They are informed, like, oh, that's cool. You do CRO. I used to do CRO back in the day. Like, we use VWO.

[00:44:34] Jim Hoffman | We're testing convert. When I speak to them, I can nerd out, and I can talk about features, right, because they're ready for that. So that's early adopters. Let's go to the fast followers. They are not informed.

[00:44:46] Jim Hoffman | They are not ready to nerd out. However, They have a problem and they wanna solve solve it. They are afflicted. Like, oh my gosh. My website, the conversion rate's killing me.

[00:44:56] Jim Hoffman | What what do I do? And so I need to speak to him or her in a problem solution format. Right? So early adopters, fast followers. So the oblivious person, this is mainstream.

[00:45:07] Jim Hoffman | This is how we go to 8 figures. This is how we we IPO, right? If you crack the code on this, it's it's game on. By the way, it's the hardest, obviously. So the oblivious person, they have a problem or, they are not informed.

[00:45:21] Jim Hoffman | They have a problem, but they don't know about, like, how to solve it or they don't even know about it. So how do we get there? How do we talk to them? We just need to get their attention. We're talking buzzfeed headlines, to get their attention.

[00:45:34] Jim Hoffman | So what I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna show this in action. I'm flipping out to to growth hit my company. I'm gonna pitch the same service, but to these 3 different personas. Okay. So the first persona is informed.

[00:45:47] Jim Hoffman | They're the ones that I'm talking features on. I wanna nerd out. So we are a conversion rate optimization agency for Shopify Plus stores. I can even be like, the focuses on cart abandonment. They're like, oh, that's exactly what I've been looking for.

[00:46:01] Jim Hoffman | Alright. Let's go to the next persona afflicted Again, they have a problem and they're looking to solve it. They're not informed yet. So I'm like, hey, is your conversion rate killing your profitability so you're not able to grow? Like, yes, it is.

[00:46:13] Jim Hoffman | Like, oh, let's let's go talk about how we could help. Alright. The third one, again, this is the hardest one. Notice how this is all about attention. Hey.

[00:46:22] Jim Hoffman | Do you wanna double sales without spending $1 on ads? You're like, oh, yes. Sign me up. It's like, oh, well, have you worked on conversion rate optimization for your website? So it's the same service that I'm just positioning differently.

[00:46:35] Jim Hoffman | Right? So it's it's all about how we're we're speaking to those people in the language that they speak or in a way that will get their attention. So, hopefully, that's helpful to see that. So, okay, this is a little bit of a warning. I kinda went a little crazy and put a lot of case studies and examples in this thing, so you guys can tell me to stop if I get too aggressive with it.

[00:46:57] Jim Hoffman | But I'm gonna go rapid fire probably like 5 to 6 examples of positioning to help you all. I try to pull

[00:47:02] Craig Swanson | in a bunch of different, business models to inspire some ideas

[00:47:02] Jim Hoffman | for you guys. So so we'll go for it real quick. Okay. This is rocket money. And, again, they're going after that middle persona of solving a problem.

[00:47:16] Jim Hoffman | And look at this headline. Get control over your subscriptions. We all have too many streaming services. It's eating into our wallets. That one problem is what allowed them to eventually get acquired by by rocket.

[00:47:28] Jim Hoffman | Okay. Let's go to Adam's shoes. Shoes, it's a commodity, space. How do you compete? I love what Adam's shoes does.

[00:47:36] Jim Hoffman | They're like, hey, did you know that, 70% of males and females, their feet are different sizes. We allow

[00:47:38] Craig Swanson | you to get a different size shoe for each foot, and we do quarter sizes, not half sizes.

[00:47:39] Jim Hoffman | So shoes that fit both your feet. Right? And so notice how, like,

[00:47:53] Craig Swanson | nuance that is, but that allowed them to become an eight figure company. Let's

[00:47:53] Jim Hoffman | talk about features. This is the person that's managing their own finances, right, I don't know. Is anyone here familiar with, like, a high yield cash savings account? Right? Basically, your money sits in Chase, makes Chase savings, makes a small, interest.

[00:48:14] Jim Hoffman | A high yield cash savings account can make, like, 5%. You all just fell asleep as I explained that I did too. They made a calculator. They're like, hey, how do you manage your stuff? You know, that cash that's sitting there?

[00:48:24] Jim Hoffman | Like, play with our tool on how much money you can make with this high yield cash savings account, because these people are informed. They're proactive figuring out what to do with their money. A couple more, Warby Parker, problem. Buying glasses isn't fun. Right?

[00:48:37] Jim Hoffman | I have to go to the store, put on a bunch, look at my wife. She tells me they look silly on me, and then it's a day. Their home try on program solved that problem. 75 pairs, shipping both ways is on them, pick out the one you want, keep it. And then figma, whenever you're designing things, sending it back and forth, a bazillion variations, their collaborative tool, obviously, was huge that was supposed to get acquired by Adobe, but then it didn't work out.

[00:49:03] Jim Hoffman | And then the last 2, this is probably my favorite example because it's problem and attention.

[00:49:09] Craig Swanson | It's combining 2 and 3, and it's spanks. They got to eight figures on the back

[00:49:09] Jim Hoffman | of two use cases. And here's the thing, when they were launching Shapewear, if they would have launched and been like, hey, can buy our Shapewear. It's made from, like, the best materials and the best stitching, you're like, I don't know what Shapewear means. So they had to speak the language of the customer. It's like, hey, do you not wanna show a penny line?

[00:49:31] Jim Hoffman | Or do you know when we're sick, silk dress and feel self conscious

[00:49:34] Craig Swanson | about it, use spanks. And again, that's like 2 skews that allowed them to become a behemoth. Alright.

[00:49:34] Jim Hoffman | So here's the final one This is the one for attention talking about going mainstream. And this one's like so obvious, but painful.

[00:49:48] Craig Swanson | This is, Truvani make this amazing protein, very good for you, but how do you crack the masses?

[00:49:49] Jim Hoffman | Very simple protein that tastes like brownies. Like protein that tastes like banana split. It's what works. So what's it's what it gets

[00:50:04] Craig Swanson | the attention when talking to the masses. Okay. So what I'll show right now is what we're doing

[00:50:04] Jim Hoffman | with growth hit and with meat. Again, just to show you, like, how we're trying to eat our own dog food, if that's the right phrase. I don't know. So we read it did a redesign of our website, and here's the headline I came up with, by the way, it was horrible. Growth is is in a guessing game.

[00:50:25] Jim Hoffman | That means nothing. Right? And I'm like, wait, I do sales. I should let's, like, do this ourselves. And what do people care about with CRO?

[00:50:32] Jim Hoffman | Am I gonna get more visitors, more buyers? And is this retainer gonna pay for itself? We literally changed that. And, like, we were able to get our cost per lead down from 500 bucks to a 150 bucks on on paid acquisition. Right?

[00:50:43] Jim Hoffman | So we're like, oh, wow. That's that's great. So with neat, this was the headline that we had with Nate when we got the company. Nothing but neat. It's like kind of a fun headline, but what does that even mean?

[00:50:55] Jim Hoffman | Right? So for us, it's all about positioning us against your regular shirt, right? So make the switch, unlike regular teas, r's, hide sweat, no no, back sweat, no pit stains. And so this this and a few other and a lot of other things actually allowed us to get the conversion rate from my point six to 4%. But my favorite experiments on a website are when I do nothing with design, but I just change the copy to make it speak the language of the customer.

[00:51:17] Craig Swanson | So so something to think through, as you're figuring

[00:51:17] Jim Hoffman | out what's the right language for you? Okay. So here is your exercise

[00:51:30] Craig Swanson | that I would like for you all to do. For your company,

[00:51:30] Jim Hoffman | for your flagship product or service, you can choose, I want you to write a headline one for the

[00:51:41] Craig Swanson | informed person where we nerd out on features, the second is for the afflicted person who has a problem and how we solve it. And the third is for the oblivious person.

[00:51:42] Jim Hoffman | How do we just get their attention? Right? To kind of bring it home to what we do. So take some time, write these headlines, and then we'll love to have you share it with your group, to see if it resonates. Alright.

[00:52:06] Jim Hoffman | How are you guys doing? Indeed another minute. Are we good? You wanna raise your hand? Are you guys good?

[00:52:10] Jim Hoffman | If done. Done. Okay. Nice.

[00:52:13] Craig Swanson | Nice. Nice. I wanna take a break here in a

[00:52:13] Jim Hoffman | second, but would anyone be open to sharing what they came up with? Any, epifonese on things you uncovered from this? Yeah. John, go for it.

[00:52:26] Craig Swanson | John is at 45 here in Seattle. I realize that I'm

[00:52:27] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | probably have my marketing message wrong. So, you know, we do hit workouts. So my

[00:52:37] John Bankson (F45) | informed was 45 minute work at which 95% of the people in the world don't even know what that means. Correct.

[00:52:44] Craig Swanson | So we we totally market to when I came down to just like the afflicted wishes. So we we have proven

[00:52:44] John Bankson (F45) | measurable program. To lose fat and gainly some gainly muscle. But that's the problem. A lot of people don't even know what that means or what how that acquires. So I went to the oblivious, and I think this is what I need to move to is we help you make a lot of look better naked.

[00:53:03] John Bankson (F45) | That's what everybody wants. Exactly. So I asked Waddler.

[00:53:09] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. Where's your checkout? What are we what are we buying? Right. This is worth it for the for that epiphany.

[00:53:11] Jim Hoffman | So I'm Nathan with wow. Okay. Nathan with 2 bar spirits here in Seattle.

[00:53:21] Nathan Kaiser (2bar Spirits) | And we make whiskey. That's the only reason I have friends. Sad, but true. No. Thanks.

[00:53:30] Nathan Kaiser (2bar Spirits) | Real quick, I keep marketing to the informed which is a small market in booze. Right? Those are the gut people who are like, what's your mash bill? How old is it? You know, what kind of oak?

[00:53:43] Nathan Kaiser (2bar Spirits) | Where is the where on the tree is the oak from? And I was like, I don't know. Versus going to the afflicted and the obvious, which is more position of value. Right? Like, we help you create memories.

[00:53:52] Nathan Kaiser (2bar Spirits) | And that is ultimately the most powerful thing in my

[00:53:52] Craig Swanson | business, but I, for ease, I keep going back to the informed,

[00:53:52] Craig Swanson | which is just

[00:54:03] Nathan Kaiser (2bar Spirits) | very difficult to keep doing,

[00:54:05] Craig Swanson | but and I know it. So I need to transition everything. That actually a really good point because as you

[00:54:05] Nathan Kaiser (2bar Spirits) | think about where your headline should be, ask yourself this one question. Where's the growth?

[00:54:18] Jim Hoffman | Right? If we wanna unblock growth, if you, you're like, I'm it's like you have this dialed in. You know how to speak to the informed person, but maybe getting to eight figures is cracking the code here. Right? If I if I if I go deep and I and I nail this, This could be the unlock.

[00:54:33] Jim Hoffman | Right? So it's like, which headline gets you to that next phase of growth? I think, that that's a good call out there on who you're going after. Well, any anybody else? Oh, yeah, Michael.

[00:54:44] Jim Hoffman | Go for it.

[00:54:46] Craig Swanson | Alright. Hey. I'm Michael Hwin. I do custom macarons. I brought some today.

[00:54:47] Craig Swanson | If you haven't tried it, go give it a try. For informed, I put

[00:54:47] Michael Huynh (Macadons) | get macarons customized the way you want it. So we have a lot of different options like

[00:55:02] Craig Swanson | packaging and printing and all sorts of customizations. For afflicted, I put can't find the perfect gift

[00:55:02] Michael Huynh (Macadons) | because a lot of people struggle to find something that's thoughtful and meaningful. And if you do you know, pictures of the person and yourself or things that they care about. I go on people's Instagram and, like, screenshot photos. So that's always good. And then for oblivious, I put want to show someone how much you care.

[00:55:31] Michael Huynh (Macadons) | Yeah. That's what I got. Thanks.

[00:55:36] Jim Hoffman | I'll be honest. That was really good. The other cool thing that you have an unfair advantage to do is, like, the different use cases you can do with your product because it's, like, consumer. It's corporate. It it's giftable.

[00:55:46] Jim Hoffman | It's seasonal. So lots of cool stuff there. Awesome. Alright. Cool.

[00:55:51] Jim Hoffman | Let's, let's take a break. If you guys are cool, fast, stretch your legs, check emails, whatever you want. Let's come back to, like, 205. Does that work for everybody? Alright.

[00:55:59] Jim Hoffman | Cool. And then we'll we'll get back into it. Alright.

[00:56:00] Craig Swanson | So we have been talking

[00:56:01] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | about we've we've obviously solved the positioning problem. Yes, John.

[00:56:14] John Bankson (F45) | Dollar moment here.

[00:56:15] Jim Hoffman | What was that moment? Was it the the naked headline?

[00:56:18] John Bankson (F45) | Yes. It was about the Olivia. So that was my $1000

[00:56:20] Jim Hoffman | mark. Alright. ROI.

[00:56:24] Craig Swanson | All of the whole all the whole thing.

[00:56:25] John Bankson (F45) | I'm like, we're gonna hit ways. Oh, okay. So I hit my, you know, Craig asked us to raise her hand with a $1000 mark today. So I hit a $1000 mark with the oblivious marketing message today. So thank you, Jim.

[00:56:38] Jim Hoffman | Craig, what's your kickback?

[00:56:39] Craig Swanson | 10%, 10%. Alright. So so maybe maybe I'm just

[00:56:39] Jim Hoffman | not getting this or or whatever. But

[00:56:51] Unnamed Speaker (General Question) | No. I'm I mean, I am getting this. So but if you're working with a company that's that's kind of doing your marketing for you, am I supposed to go in there and teach them this? That's my thing. It's like, I hate marketing.

[00:57:03] Unnamed Speaker (General Question) | That's why I hire them. So I'm gonna have to teach them to do their marketing. But I okay.

[00:57:11] Jim Hoffman | We have a team that'd

[00:57:12] Craig Swanson | love to talk to you, but no. I I yeah. I do think it's, like, either

[00:57:12] Jim Hoffman | you or having a person internally that can wrangle and manage whatever freelancers or contractors you hire, setting those guardrails. I do think this is on us a little bit as as founders to set the positioning. We do it as a service, but, I do think it is at the end of the the markers that under or the founders that understand marketing and can set them off, can do some really exciting things. Is that helpful, though, that you have to do a little bit of marketing? That's not what you wanted to hear.

[00:57:44] Jim Hoffman | Was it? Okay. Got it. K. So, alright.

[00:57:52] Jim Hoffman | Positioning. We figured that out. Unblocked. Let's go to the next one. Conversion.

[00:57:58] Jim Hoffman | Alright. We figured out our positioning. We're driving traffic to the site. What the heck? It's not converting.

[00:58:05] Jim Hoffman | So let's go back to your questions. Right? Do you have a consistently strong conversion rate and by traffic source? Cause with me, we can send an email and have a great conversion rate, but I can test TikTok ads and it's horrible. Right?

[00:58:17] Jim Hoffman | So does it scale? 2nd, Do you have an activation offer? So what does this mean? Too many times, we'll work with a really cool product, really cool software product, cool branding, cool website, no conversion. They forgot that final mile of you need to give people a reason to buy now.

[00:58:37] Jim Hoffman | You need to create that urgency. So we'll get into that. And then our customer's converting in an ROI positive way. Right? We're able to convert the early adopters, but what about the informed?

[00:58:46] Jim Hoffman | What about the oblivious? What about paid channels? As we talk about growth and scale, that one's very key. Okay. So, hold on one second.

[00:58:57] Jim Hoffman | Oh, yeah. There it is. So this is what we're gonna talk about. Your irresistible offer and your activation strategy. You know how to talk to people.

[00:59:05] Jim Hoffman | How do we activate them? That's the main goal of this sec second section. So I wanna talk about conversion rate for a second right now. So if you look at your conversion rate, that could be your site conversion rate, your sales conversion rate, your offline conversion rate, there's a little bit more focus on scaling online. So here's the bad news.

[00:59:26] Jim Hoffman | Most of us 90% of our traffic isn't converting. Right? Even if you have, like, a 7% conversion rate on e commerce, you're amazing. What about your lead form rate right now for B2B Companies? What is that?

[00:59:39] Jim Hoffman | Is that 10%? That that'd be fantastic. But here's the good news. We've done a lot of CRO testing, and there are usually no more than 7 reasons why you're getting a higher conversion right now. It could be price, trust, quality, confusion, urgency.

[00:59:55] Jim Hoffman | So I want you to ask yourself right now, are these 7 which is the 1 or 2 that is the main blocker conversion, and usually, well, not usually, a lot of times, it's confusion. People are they come to your website and within 15 seconds, They are skeptical. They're on mobile. They're like, I don't know what this is. Sorry.

[01:00:18] Jim Hoffman | I went out. It looks like every other agency or every other product, and so we're gonna get into this. So what I wanna do right now is give you the cheat code on If your conversion rate isn't working, if you can't activate people, I wanna do these 2 frameworks. So the first one, there's a lot of people that talk about offers, Alex Ramosi, $1,000,000 offer. There's some really good form to it.

[01:00:42] Jim Hoffman | This this is probably my favorite one that we've tested. And it's the irresistible offer formula. So there there's 4 components. So, basically, first, your dream outcome, what does your client want to achieve? Are you saving in time, money?

[01:00:55] Jim Hoffman | What does your customer wanna achieve? Second, how likely is it? They're gonna hit that. Oh, thank you. Is that better?

[01:01:05] Jim Hoffman | Cool. Likelihood of achievement. Right? This one, I think, is the most impactful. Time delay gratification, there's a reason why we'll go to Amazon if we can get it same day or next day.

[01:01:18] Jim Hoffman | And this one's also a big, effort or sacrifice. Like, there's a reason why 7 minute abs is very impactful. I'll have to do 7 minutes a day, and I'm gonna get a 6 pack, sign me up. So if these 4 components, which is the one you could knock out of the park, if you make a really killer offer, right? Another one you could layer on there is, like, a guarantee.

[01:01:40] Jim Hoffman | So what I wanna do right now is show these offers in action because, hopefully, you you have that formula I gave you, but for me, it didn't really resonate till I saw some examples. So I pulled together what I think are, like, you know, black belt level of of offers. So I'm gonna show you the first one. This is, I believe, a saddle based, venture backed startup. They raise a massive round of funding on this one offer that I I think this is the the gold standard.

[01:02:06] Jim Hoffman | So this is Main Street. And if you're a startup, there's ways you can get grants and money, and they will find that money for you. But look at look at this headline. Get $50,000 back from the IRS in 20 minutes. Like, great aspiration, great time delay to gratification, and then let's look at effort or sacrifice.

[01:02:24] Jim Hoffman | We do the paperwork. You get the cash. If we don't find you any money, you don't pay anything. Like, this is all done within, like, 30 to 40 words. Like, that that is amazing.

[01:02:35] Jim Hoffman | This is how they, went to the the level that they did and and got acquired. So that that's one that's on the the b to b side of, like, an amazing offer. Let's go to the consumer side. This is Curology. They raised $40,000,000 on the back of this offer.

[01:02:49] Jim Hoffman | So they do personalized skin care product.

[01:02:51] Craig Swanson | Right? Think of it as a a proactive competitor. So what's their activation offer? They literally give you the free

[01:02:51] Jim Hoffman | product or the formulation 1st month is free, and then it flips to a 2 month subscription. That's sixty bucks. They have a quiz funnel. This is what put them on the map. Was this offer of giving away the product?

[01:03:12] Jim Hoffman | But knowing because of their business model and their LTV, they'd make it back and then have profits. This is another one, a SAS product, our B2B. By the way, if anybody who owns B2B that gets a lot of leads, who's using this tool right now, our B2B. Check this out. You can put on your website for free.

[01:03:33] Jim Hoffman | Everyone that comes to your website in the US, you can see their LinkedIn and their email so you can retarget. It's really powerful. But they give you the product for free with the free Slack integration. And then after a month, you can decide if you want the export and if you want the tool. They are growing like crazy right now on the back of this offer.

[01:03:52] Jim Hoffman | It's becoming a red ocean as far as people playing with this new technology. But their offer is allowing them to go to that next level. So if you're in that space where you have a lot of competition, can you win on your offer? Alright. This is actually a client that we had.

[01:04:06] Jim Hoffman | They, they help. I loved it. I love this business. They help people that take the MCAT the second time. They're like, I'm a go to Harvard.

[01:04:14] Jim Hoffman | They take the MCAT. They're like, I'm gonna go to, like, community college. I can't get in anywhere. And so basically, he will guarantee he will lift your MCAT score by 17 points. With, like, a custom program, and he knows how to speak the language.

[01:04:28] Jim Hoffman | So, he also he does the guarantee. He does a 120 day program. So, like, effort or sacrifice. Very cool. Alright.

[01:04:36] Jim Hoffman | Let me go with one more. This is one of the most impressive ones. This is ConvertKit. It's an email all competitive to Mailchimp, and they had a huge conversion issue. People like, love the product.

[01:04:50] Jim Hoffman | I, you know, specifically for creators, I can sell e products on it, but no one was converting. He was at a 3000 MRR for 18 months. He almost closed the business down, but then he launched an offer where he's like, hey, are you graduating from Mailchimp to convert We will do your migration for free. We'll invite all your email flows, all your templates, it's all nuts. And look how aggressive he is in this footer, switch from Mailchimp, switch from Infusionsoft, switch from Aweber.

[01:05:16] Jim Hoffman | They're now at $50,000,000 a year. All on the back of this activation offer of, of unlocking conversion. And so I I love that one as an example because, he he kinda lost a lot of money upfront, and he had to wait for a long payback time. But hopefully that's helpful. Just seeing some of these offers in action, is really fun.

[01:05:36] Craig Swanson | Okay. So that's the first thing. What is your offer? Now here's

[01:05:36] Jim Hoffman | the second thing. How do you take that offer and package you up? Right? So, like, let me take this offer and let me put it into the wild. So, when we work with a client and they're like, Jim, can we hit this growth goal?

[01:05:55] Jim Hoffman | Can we get these new customers? I can almost always say, absolutely. But then my next question is, like, how aggressive are you willing to be to get new customers? Cause I can get you new customers, but it's like, does the business model support it? So what I wanna give you right now is a spectrum of here's all the ways you can activate customers from least aggressive to most aggressive.

[01:06:20] Jim Hoffman | And your business model, your balance sheet, are you venture backed, are you bootstrapped, has a huge impact on this. So I'm gonna walk through this, and I'm gonna show you examples, and I'll show you what we're doing. To try and pull this off. So, you know, you could launch a, a course. You could do a fun quiz funnel.

[01:06:38] Jim Hoffman | The those are things to activate people on your website. Anybody here, you super human. Do we have any super human users for, Gmail? I love it. Great tool.

[01:06:48] Jim Hoffman | They did one of the hardest things on, like, scarcity and FOMO with their launch program, so early access. Obviously, we can discount, true classic with bundles, like, doing that. This one's super annoying, but it still works giveaways. You can absolutely activate. I think I'll show an example.

[01:07:06] Jim Hoffman | We got, like, 30,000 emails on the back of a giveaway in in 2 weeks. This one's huge. Giving away a product for free in the exchange for referral.

[01:07:15] Craig Swanson | This is absolutely the my favorite to do because you turn customers

[01:07:15] Jim Hoffman | into marketers. And then finally, if I have to convert customers, I'll just give them money. I will just pay you to become a customer. So obviously, like, PayPal did that. They would credit you, I think it was like $20 to create a PayPal account.

[01:07:35] Jim Hoffman | They were burning, I think, like, a $1,000,000 a month, and then guilt would give you $25 when you invited someone and they, they became a customer. And that worked really well intelligent, but it they they they grew, until they couldn't turn turn it around. So this is your spectrum of how to package up your offers from least aggressive to most aggressive. So let let me put more color on these on how this works. So, you could give a free tool to activate people on your website.

[01:08:06] Jim Hoffman | This is a client, their insurance company, There there's a lot of issues with this website just because people would come in. They're like, I don't even know what term life insurance is. So we're like, okay, we need to define what it is because they're oblivious. And then second, they were worried about how expensive it is. They're like, hey, it's just 10 bucks per month.

[01:08:23] Jim Hoffman | Here's what was magic. We built this tool where it's like, let's get an instant quote. So if there's a lot of people in here where you have an unfair advantage where you can build technology or a free tool, call it engineering as marketing, that that can be big. Alright. Again, I'm gonna go in from least aggressive to most aggressive.

[01:08:40] Jim Hoffman | This is 3rd love. They're going after Victoria's Secret. So you're going after an incumbent, a lot of money, big market share. How do you convert? How do you activate?

[01:08:50] Jim Hoffman | They can't just be like, oh, come check, They're amazing. They chose what to compete on in its fit, right, bra size, going to the fitting room. They put you in this quiz funnel, and then it spits out a product that's personally recommended for you. They're taking huge market share from Victoria's Secret on the back of, well, knowing their their problem they're solving and knowing how to activate that persona with this quiz funnel. Okay.

[01:09:17] Jim Hoffman | Another one that's still, kinda mildly aggressive, not too bad. This is one of my favorites. Buffer, social media scheduling tool. They're catching, kind of early adopters, but they're also early in their fear for social media. And what they do is they launch a 25 day email course, where it's like, hey, sign up.

[01:09:38] Jim Hoffman | We're gonna drip you 25 lessons on how to run social media to become a thought leader, and it trains you to open their email inbox. So when you need a social media scheduling tool, you're gonna think about them. Alright. Let's go a little more aggressive here. This is one of my favorites.

[01:09:54] Jim Hoffman | This is Saleel Jane. He's actually in Seattle. I'm trying to get him an EO. Maybe it'll convert. But, when they launched a girlfriend collective, it was like his, like, you know, active wear and, like, leggings were really kind of, like, becoming like the thing.

[01:10:08] Jim Hoffman | And the product was expensive. It's ninety bucks, and people had lots of sticker shock. And there was a value issue look what he did in his navigation. Right under SHOP, he put earn free leggings. You share this on social.

[01:10:22] Jim Hoffman | They give you $90 leggings for free. They ended up getting 4 figures of new customers. And what they found was it was cheaper to acquire people with this method than going to social ads and Instagram. Because if you share this on your account, you have more brand affinity with with this company. And so the lifetime value, how much more people bought from the company, was better with that that person.

[01:10:48] Jim Hoffman | Go for it. Oh, yeah. Did you get the free leggings? Wow. That's amazing.

[01:10:56] Jim Hoffman | It's that easy. This is one this is a client we had where we had the unfair advantage. They had a castle. It was a winery. So we're like, why don't we use this castle as like a marketing move?

[01:11:07] Jim Hoffman | Why are we hiding the castle? So we're like, we're gonna fly you out, win a trip to the castle. And it worked pretty well. Much in many of the converting to, wine subscription holders. That's a little trickier.

[01:11:20] Jim Hoffman | But we got a lot of emails and a lot of first time customers. But something to test. Okay. I'll show you what's working and not working with with my companies. So with growth hit, this is lease aggressive.

[01:11:32] Jim Hoffman | We do a lot of content that we'll gate just to get you into our email and our CRM. Alright, Mike 3. Thank you. Thank you. So, this is something we do.

[01:11:43] Jim Hoffman | This is pretty obvious, but, we'll then have custom emails based on how people came in. Are you a B2B company or B2C company? This will So we will do, basically a free, like, $2, that we'll do that can work pretty well.

[01:12:06] Casey Cronk (First Security) | Let me try this one.

[01:12:17] Jim Hoffman | I'll show you what I'm

[01:12:18] John Bankson (F45) | testing with the need.

[01:12:21] Jim Hoffman | So many mic drops. Thank you. The radio? Mic

[01:12:25] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | drop. Do you have

[01:12:26] Jim Hoffman | a megaphone or just megaphone? So here's what we're testing with a need. I'll be honest on what's working, what's not working. So, we have the no sweat guarantee. If you sweat through our shirt, you get it for free.

[01:12:37] Jim Hoffman | Bundles So this traffic section. We're also doing these active cart, free shipping, free shirt, but

[01:12:47] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | here's the one that works really well. We stole

[01:12:57] Jim Hoffman | collectives a move. We did a free tea campaign, and I forgot to turn it off, and we gave away weight free shirts. And it it worked a little too well. So, I got in trouble for that one. But, One works, just control it and monitor other Shopify.

[01:13:13] Jim Hoffman | Hopefully, those are good examples, of these activation offers. Oh, I'm holding it the wrong way. Maybe like that? Okay. User error.

[01:13:27] Jim Hoffman | Thank you, Jennifer. Okay. So hopefully that's helpful. See how I'm trying to put this in in action. Mark, thank you for the plug.

[01:13:38] Jim Hoffman | Alright. So I

[01:13:39] Craig Swanson | wanna try something a little different. Let's do some live coaching. If anyone is game enough to give me their website, we can check it out. We can go through it and

[01:13:39] Jim Hoffman | see what an activation offer should be. Do we wanna do a some some life stuff. I pulled together some websites, and I'm gonna make people come here and type it in. I don't type in public, as far as what your website is. So I just pulled some,

[01:14:06] Craig Swanson | Oh, oh, they're being voluntold.

[01:14:09] Jim Hoffman | What's that?

[01:14:09] Craig Swanson | They're being voluntold that they're going to be sharing the

[01:14:12] Jim Hoffman | No. I'm sorry. I just, I have I just pulled a bunch from the list you sent me. And I don't have everybody here. I don't know why Derek's here picking on him.

[01:14:20] Jim Hoffman | I'm sorry that yours is the first.

[01:14:23] Craig Swanson | But we do not have to do

[01:14:23] Jim Hoffman | your company at all. But, again, this is supposed to be, very helpful if we wanna do live coaching and look at your websites and your activation offers. How do we feel about this thumbs up or thumbs down? Alright.

[01:14:40] Craig Swanson | So I'll run a mic out to whoever's doing the live coaching. So who's going first?

[01:14:48] Jim Hoffman | Brian, if you had? Oh, yeah.

[01:14:49] Craig Swanson | What's that? Raise your hand.

[01:14:51] Jim Hoffman | Okay.

[01:14:51] Craig Swanson | There you go.

[01:14:53] Jim Hoffman | So, this is your home page. Right? This is our home page. She had call us group. Derek and I are part of cybersecurity change, consulting.

[01:15:02] Jim Hoffman | Okay.

[01:15:04] Craig Swanson | Congratulations on being here. Thank you. So we'll get into it. So when I look at a website, there's, like, three things I'm asking myself.

[01:15:04] Jim Hoffman | What is this? Why should I do it with you and why now? And one thing to really think through is, like, if we have any, confusion on the website, it's a no. So we wanna get really cute with tag lines or whatever. So, like, be very direct.

[01:15:28] Jim Hoffman | So secure your future with us as I look at, first off, great branding. I think, like, this is awesome. You look expensive as hell, which I think is good, because you want people to think that. This is really well done. This headline, secure your future with us.

[01:15:43] Jim Hoffman | It's doing one thing that I really like. You second person. It's benefit focus. You.

[01:15:47] Craig Swanson | One issue that I have with this one, secure your future with us in the vacuum, we could be financial services, we

[01:15:48] Jim Hoffman | could be personal security, we could be cyber security. Right? And so what I'm looking for here is, do I actually know what this is? Like, we are your trusted partner in shaping a secure, successful future for every aspect of your organization. Now, like, it it took me, like, 15 to 16 words to start to draw the conclusion there on on what this is.

[01:16:17] Jim Hoffman | Because before you can activate me, I need to be very clear on on what I'm looking at, like what this is, why I should do with you, and why now. So and again, this is above the fold. And I wanna call out, like, look at your website, like, you're a super skeptical person. It's like, you have to win me over in 10 seconds. Right?

[01:16:38] Jim Hoffman | Because here's the thing that I'm assuming is I go through this website below the fold, I'm starting to get more of those questions answered. What is this? Why should I do it with you and why now? Those are three things to say. And I wanna answer that above the fold.

[01:16:56] Jim Hoffman | That's a really big call out because a lot of times, like, you guys have some great stuff. I'm assuming below the fold. Yeah. You're, like, saying exactly what you do. You're answering that question.

[01:17:08] Jim Hoffman | But just know that we need to start to tease that in that, hero section because whether on mobile or desktop, we've done so many heat maps and scroll maps. People do not scroll. So you have to factor that in. That's one thing I'm thinking through. So let's go to the offer.

[01:17:24] Jim Hoffman | So right now, there is no call to action on the the hero section. So I wanna be told what to do. If I'm someone that's like, okay, what's my next step? However, I think I saw it. There is a nice clear step here.

[01:17:39] Jim Hoffman | Your future is secured when your business can use, maintain, improve its technology. So we are speaking to the aspiration, which I like. Request a free consultation. What do I get out of it? What is in it for me?

[01:17:52] Jim Hoffman | Those are things I'm thinking too. By the way, we struggled with this as well. We started testing 25 minute consultation at the end of it. It will show screenshots of what they get after it. That's our top landing page right now because we had a very similar, kind of setup.

[01:18:08] Jim Hoffman | So anyway, those are some things that I'm thinking through on the activation offer. The other thing, if I go up here oh, okay. Well, so I can call Do you guys get mostly form fills, or do you go for phone calls? It's more that's more so if they have a an an issue, they're jumping into it? Gotcha.

[01:18:28] Jim Hoffman | Is that for new prospects or clients? So

[01:18:34] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | you

[01:18:42] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | wow.

[01:18:48] Unnamed Speaker (Cybersecurity) | We can't help that for all the operational reasons, like, we have to be very quick on our triage to be able to refer out and make sure they're getting help because even if we go, sorry. We're gonna have brand damage. If we had to help them even if it's a non economic help.

[01:19:04] Jim Hoffman | So tell me your team is able to field, like, real time calls to, like, give

[01:19:09] Craig Swanson | them a solution on how to solve whatever cyber security issue

[01:19:09] Jim Hoffman | would be coming up.

[01:19:14] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | That's where we're trying to lean into.

[01:19:15] Jim Hoffman | I mean, we've had this You just wrote your offer right there. That's some that's magic because of, like, the time delay to gratification. Because sometimes that time delay doesn't have to be to, like, get your 6 pack. It's like, I'm gonna get you your program to get a 6 pack in 27 minutes. Right?

[01:19:32] Jim Hoffman | So you have that. So it's like, those can be leading indicators to getting a great client. Right? And again, I don't the thing to think about too is, like, who's coming to this page? Is it people where this could be your flagship products or offer to get them in the door?

[01:19:46] Jim Hoffman | That could be huge. Right? Or if it's more of the sophisticated buyer that wants you for all the services, that might not be the right offer. And you can make a custom funnel for, that persona as well.

[01:19:56] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | And that, I mean, I think that's a challenge we have as most of the traffic we see is people have gotten to us through referral or more, you know, standard inside inside or outside sales methods, and then they're coming to credential. Like, they're showing up and they're clicking on our resources and wanting to look at our cuss our customer stories. They wanna scroll down to the bottom and see our logo And are they are they big enough? Have we worked, which I think is still there, right, Brian? Yeah, god.

[01:20:23] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | It's all the way down

[01:20:24] Craig Swanson | to that.

[01:20:25] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | Yeah. So, you know, you

[01:20:26] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | you Yeah.

[01:20:27] Jim Hoffman | I mean, those are big names too. It's like, I because if I don't know you, It's like if I see that up front, you're addressing, like, why I should do it with you. It's like, oh, they've worked with Nordstrom. It's like, that's that's a big deal.

[01:20:39] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | Okay. What else don't you like?

[01:20:44] Jim Hoffman | Well, I wanna speak to something on branding. I I don't like it when people like, oh, I need to do a rebrand. However, the branding speaks to quality, which which speaks to value, which can command getting better deals at a good price. So I do wanna say that came across, which is very much a positive. Cause you could have a lot of the same stuff, but if the brand doesn't respect the value you're trying to sell, there can be a disconnect that doesn't work there.

[01:21:11] Jim Hoffman | So good job there.

[01:21:12] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | That's all Brian, by the way.

[01:21:14] Craig Swanson | That's all

[01:21:15] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | I have.

[01:21:15] Craig Swanson | So that's

[01:21:16] Jim Hoffman | really well done. But now this is this is good. Thank you for

[01:21:22] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | your share. I don't think

[01:21:24] Jim Hoffman | anybody else wants to go next. Right?

[01:21:27] Craig Swanson | Alright.

[01:21:28] Jim Hoffman | Let me here you go. Will you come type in your URL? Do you mind coming up here and putting in your URL?

[01:21:36] Liz Philpot (Eat Seattle Tours) | Me?

[01:21:36] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. I don't type in public. It'll be too painful. We're doing the back and forth. It's like, is it a dotco.com?

[01:21:46] Jim Hoffman | Nobody wants to see that.

[01:21:51] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | So tiny. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Okay.

[01:22:05] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | So one other framework framework I'd

[01:22:09] Jim Hoffman | wanna give you when looking at a website, so Optimizely is an AB testing tool. They looked at the top 2000 web pages and their testing tool,

[01:22:21] Craig Swanson | and they came up with this formula of 5. And I actually see a lot of that in here.

[01:22:21] Jim Hoffman | So the the first thing on, like, the top landing pages is your headline should It should be a benefit focused statement that speaks to what the person gets coming out of this. So the thing I'd it doesn't answer that one, but you do something really well. If we go back to the other framework, what is this? This is very clear. So, like, bonus points for that.

[01:22:46] Jim Hoffman | That's one. The second thing, that I look for is, like, for an image or a video, you need to ask yourself, does this align with my headline, my benefit focus headline, or the transformation I want to do? So basically, this needs to work together, and this is, because I know what it is. Here, you're selling me on the aspiration and the dream of of what to do. Okay.

[01:23:08] Jim Hoffman | So there's 2 things. Good job. Three social proof That can be in stats, logos. It can be in, testimonials and quotes. So we have that here.

[01:23:20] Jim Hoffman | And it looks like we have some badges here as well. Okay. Nice. So here's the big thing for me that I'm thinking through is that activation offer, because right now, the the CTA is a little generic in the sense that it says buy tickets. So a lot of us have these generic CTAs.

[01:23:37] Jim Hoffman | Right? It's like, Shop now, learn more, buy now. However, I do like that she's flattening the funnel to go straight to that conversion of it, which, in in cases like this, can make sense. But here's where here's where I wanna go with this is. You're telling me what this is.

[01:23:53] Jim Hoffman | Why should I do with you with the social proof? The third thing, like, why now. Right? And that's where the offer can come into play on why to do this now. So are there any things that you've tested in the past?

[01:24:05] Jim Hoffman | With offers. It could be promos or deals. It could be, like, scarcity on limited supply of things for a tour that you're doing. But any any color or comments on that?

[01:24:16] Liz Philpot (Eat Seattle Tours) | Often, if you go to a calendar, we show the bookings in terms of the scarcity. So then you see that they're filling up and there's not much space. So I think that gets people to book faster. The count the calendar's not on the home page is the is on the menu.

[01:24:33] Jim Hoffman | Oh, gotcha. Oh, hold on one second. Oh, sorry. Just one call out. Oh, wait.

[01:24:40] Jim Hoffman | It went away. I wanted to say something that I liked, but that we'll go back.

[01:24:44] Liz Philpot (Eat Seattle Tours) | So, like, 2 left kind of, like, over there. That's kind of the that's the only scarcity kind of feeling.

[01:24:50] Jim Hoffman | Okay. That's actually nice. So one thing, like, with neat is we sell I'll tell you what, since I we sold out of our product and anytime you sell out, that is such a great marketing moment to hype up. Similar if you're a service based business, and you're like, hey, we're not accepting clients for 2 more months. If you can actually put that on there, you're like, oh my gosh.

[01:25:10] Jim Hoffman | How do I get on the wait list? So, use that as as your advantage. One thing I wanna call out too is, notice how this is scannable, not readable, especially on mobile where you can easily understand, like, what you're gonna get out of this, which is very, very key. Okay. Now this is awesome.

[01:25:35] Jim Hoffman | What do you guys think?

[01:25:35] Craig Swanson | Any other comments on this website? How are we feeling? Like, I would want a time clock on there and a

[01:25:36] Jim Hoffman | call to action to motivate me to take an action in the moment.

[01:25:45] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | So if somebody who's like, I'm a really I'm a real passionate consumer of quality food. So I'll be like, what's going on? I was just telling Liz this. Like, oh my god, it's King Salmon season. I better get in there before all all the kings are gone Yeah.

[01:25:59] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | Because there's a catch limit on that. So we're not gonna see them forever. And then I'm gonna turn around and be like, oh my goodness. It's November. Chantrells are popping.

[01:26:08] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | Time to go. I wanna get my Chantrell on. And it's so on and so forth. Throughout the year, you could have these, like, micro offers in there, maybe that take a a couple months, I think, a couple months or 2, because people it takes a while for the public to kind of recognize. So too fast, you're not gonna get traction too slow.

[01:26:30] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | You're not gonna get it either.

[01:26:32] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. You're hitting on, like, a key activation offer. I was trying to show the the mock up. Yeah, here it is. Like, this one that's super human does, the early access and scarcity, if you can pull that off, that's amazing.

[01:26:46] Jim Hoffman | So it's like this home page, yes, we did never lose sight that first time visitors need to know what this is, but it's like, you know, it's it's King Salmon season. 50 spots left. We only have two things coming up before the season's out. That helps answer that third question of why now is what you're getting to, which can be really powerful. And by the way, these little tweaks, it's amazing.

[01:27:07] Jim Hoffman | Like, some of them will flaw, but some of them can be transformative for your funnel. Say it good.

[01:27:11] Liz Philpot (Eat Seattle Tours) | Well, I think the tricky thing is the SEO at that point as well is, like, we're trying to get the keywords and the headlines that are gonna be recognized.

[01:27:18] Jim Hoffman | I I would think through how much work is the homepage doing from an SEO perspective? And could you get some work from an SEO perspective from from other pages? But, but I totally hear you though. If this is a moneymaker from an SEO perspective, then you're absolutely

[01:27:32] Craig Swanson | right.

[01:27:33] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | All your SEO on the back end. So you just load up all those keywords on the back end that people are searching. And whatever you put on the landing page is seasonal, that can rotate But keep your anchor heavy and your anchor big. Give her

[01:27:43] Jim Hoffman | a mic. We'll talk. I want your cyber security service. Yes.

[01:27:56] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | Because

[01:28:00] Unnamed Speaker (Cybersecurity) | this, what, why should you do it

[01:28:02] Craig Swanson | by right now? Any pieces are a point you can share on how

[01:28:02] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | this one's, like, incredibly beautiful and lots of pictures and stuff, and obviously ours is quite simple to say. Yeah.

[01:28:12] Jim Hoffman | Well, it How do you

[01:28:13] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | think about video screen?

[01:28:15] Unnamed Speaker (Cybersecurity) | What you would actually hear about from, imagery design elements that relates to your questions?

[01:28:21] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. Well, one kinda like a side story. We had a a law firm that hired us. They did this huge, beautiful redesign of a website, and their conversions fell off a cliff. And they hired us.

[01:28:31] Jim Hoffman | They're like, we didn't realize we had lightning in a bottle. Can you reverse engineer that? And we had to go back and realize that, like, design can help, but it can also hurt. It's all about, like, what's the decision journey someone needs to go through. To make a buying decision or lead form decision.

[01:28:46] Jim Hoffman | And if design enhances it, then game on, but sometimes design can get in the way of it. So, to to directly answer your question, like, with yours, I don't think, like, videos or whatever is necessarily necessary. It's more of like that decision journey because, like, with what you do, you're not selling experience or t shirts. You can use text and, like, graphics rather than, like, beautiful design. However, with this, with video imagery to my point on your headline and your image or video should relate, you so here's what I like to do.

[01:29:19] Jim Hoffman | I like to do one of two things. My headline speaks to the transformation or the benefit of you're gonna get. And the image or video supports that, or I pour salt in the wound of the problem and I show how you get you get out of it, or I heighten that problem. So I like it when you can have them compliment each other, if that makes sense. That helpful?

[01:29:38] Jim Hoffman | Are you texting or not paying attention? K. Very cool. Alright.

[01:29:46] Liz Philpot (Eat Seattle Tours) | Thank you.

[01:29:47] Jim Hoffman | Thank you. Really good job. Do we wanna keep the live coaching going? How are you feeling? I'm feeling bad.

[01:29:53] Jim Hoffman | That's it. What's that one? Okay. Yes.

[01:29:56] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | The next mic. Alright. Who is this? Oh, oh, yes. None of your clients now to talk about you.

[01:30:07] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | No one. Alright.

[01:30:12] Jim Hoffman | First, thank you for being here.

[01:30:25] Craig Swanson | So if I look at this in a vacuum, just

[01:30:25] Jim Hoffman | the hero section, I see project portfolio management, adaptive, predictive delivered, First, I'm like, is this a photography portfolio? Is this my scrapbook portfolio? Is this architecture portfolio? So I have a little bit of confusion, and I think my answers are gonna be here, and I will scroll to get to it. The other thing is obviously wanting to know, like, hold my hand.

[01:30:51] Jim Hoffman | What is that next step in the conversion funnel? There's this idea of, attention ratio. So ask yourself, how many things am I asking someone to do in this section right now? So right now, I see 5. And they're all equally weighted, we could say that home is primary because it's left to right, but I never wanna question the attention ratio of, like, how many things I'm asking and what's primary.

[01:31:13] Jim Hoffman | So that's one thing that I see since there's no call to action. And then the landscape of business today. This is a fun aspirational headline, but as I'm still a little confused, I'm having to work. And as people go through a website, they get fatigue, and think of this as a rule of thumb. In in fifteen seconds, kinda know what this is and why it should do with you.

[01:31:33] Jim Hoffman | The other one and the urgency we can play with that, and I would like to have that in the hero section, but but that's what I'm kinda going through right now processing this. Let's continue to scroll. Gotcha. So you're hitting on a value statement. I'm still a little confused.

[01:31:52] Jim Hoffman | And then okay. There we are. Like, these are big logos and brands that you're working with, which is super impressive, where if I see this up front, you have bought probably 30 seconds of time where I'm like, these guys are the real deal. I will continue to, like, scroll and and look through what they are. Okay.

[01:32:13] Jim Hoffman | So one thing I like here, I'm a huge sucker. I my team says I do it too much. I love question statements as headlines. So I like what's happening here. I'm not a fan of bulky paragraphs.

[01:32:23] Jim Hoffman | I wanna make it scannable. So they don't have to read it. And then, the generic call to action, like, what's that unique next step in the journey? So instead of contact us or, like, get a 20 minute strategy session or get your, like, free portfolio assessment, like, whatever that thing could be. But anyway, what do you guys think?

[01:32:42] Jim Hoffman | Any thoughts or feedback on this? Yeah. Well, we can do the mic this time.

[01:32:48] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | In my business, we find that people don't read. I have a med spa. So we do Botox fillers, lasers, IVs. And it's a constant problem that people don't read. I don't read.

[01:33:04] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | I looked at that thing, and I was like, oh my god. That's a lot of reading. So how do you get your message in front of your client without providing essays or paragraphs for them to get through? Think about that.

[01:33:20] Craig Swanson | So I just have a question. Is anyone in this room a potential client for

[01:33:24] Craig Swanson | this business? Oh, for this. Does anyone in this

[01:33:24] Craig Swanson | room know somebody who's a potential client for this business? Could you even describe it? There we go.

[01:33:50] Jim Hoffman | So if you're the informed

[01:33:51] Craig Swanson | person, you're probably like, game on, let me devour this content. Right? But for those

[01:33:51] Jim Hoffman | other 2 personas, it's like, we we need that protein shake with the banana split to get their attention. Right? But, they

[01:34:05] Unnamed Speaker (Cybersecurity) | Services company were in in our con and moreover we call

[01:34:07] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | them practitioners, like, the besides the message to speak too much.

[01:34:14] Unnamed Speaker (Cybersecurity) | Technical audience Yeah. That is that for lawyers and other, you know, places you see a lot of that.

[01:34:21] Jim Hoffman | You're so right because we're so in the details. We're like, sure. Everybody, like, knows what, like, ABM means. And it's like, they didn't know what that acronym means. So you're totally, right with that.

[01:34:31] Jim Hoffman | One thing I wanna show, let me see if they still have it. These guys, I think, do a good job. It's a little noisy, but they're doing some things really well. Right? Like, they have a very clear activation offer.

[01:34:43] Jim Hoffman | Their social proof is up here. But in, like, for so you know what they're going for, but let me show, let me see if they still have it. To your point, Derek, yeah. Wait. They used to have this download for personas?

[01:34:59] Jim Hoffman | Like, are you a new CSO? Are you new? Oh, they don't have anymore. This is also nice to start here. But, you can kind of have 2 activation offers on your website.

[01:35:09] Jim Hoffman | 1 could be going for the jugular for the consultation or whatever. You can have a second where it's a different activation offer, like, for us to be the CMO's checklist or the entrepreneur's checklist before they they grow. So I wouldn't want them to be equal in weight and real estate on the website, one needs to be primary and the other would be secondary.

[01:35:28] Craig Swanson | That way you can speak to 2 different personas a

[01:35:29] Jim Hoffman | little bit with how you activate it, George.

[01:35:39] Unnamed Speaker (General Comment) | Question about the the credibility, like showing creds via the your customer carousel there. Right? We've talked about examples that have seen that and you were suggesting putting that above the fold. We're we used to have that, and then we changed to, 3 really high impact case studies just below the fold Yeah. Of of big names, big logos.

[01:35:58] Unnamed Speaker (General Comment) | And, in the case of what they do, which is complicating very targeted and specific, does that help, tell the message of what they do. Like, what do you think of that strategy as a comparison? Or you can put up the website if you wanted to compare. So You wanna

[01:36:18] Jim Hoffman | come type it in? Sure. So you're hitting on so we actually found that as well. Like, if we can get a video testimonial in front of someone that's at the exact same growth phase. It's an unlocked.

[01:36:31] Jim Hoffman | So I actually like video testimonials the best for that informed person. Yeah. Jordan, go ahead and come up and type it in if you'd like. But if you guys can get that, that's that's amazing. We've been paying client or not paying clients.

[01:36:43] Jim Hoffman | We've been giving them kickbacks if they'll give us a good video reviews. We do the good work. We don't just pay them do that, I think, hopefully.

[01:36:55] Unnamed Speaker (General Comment) | I didn't mean testimonials. I meant, like, the case studies. So we go right into the logos, but via very, brief case studies. To the point

[01:37:08] Jim Hoffman | sensational head oh, sorry. Give it more of a sensational headline, right, like,

[01:37:10] Craig Swanson | how we, like, increase

[01:37:10] Jim Hoffman | productivity by 30% for this this health tech SaaS or something like that. Because who knows if people are actually gonna read through it? But this is an awesome form of social proof. The fact that you're investing this, I just think this is where the magic moment is. That's what I care about.

[01:37:28] Jim Hoffman | It's like, oh, I'm like this company, here's the before, here's the after, like, sign me up. I I think that's awesome. Is that what you're you're asking? Yeah.

[01:37:36] Craig Swanson | I would say, like, I do

[01:37:37] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | have to work to know how legit you are. And

[01:37:47] Jim Hoffman | That's the only thing because, like, these are huge. You know what I mean? Having Google is like a very big deal.

[01:37:51] Craig Swanson | So I do both. You can kinda see we're a little overkill

[01:37:51] Jim Hoffman | where it's like scroll, case studies, This is where we're going after, like, CEOs, that's me recording when my kids are sleeping. That's awesome. So yeah. But, yeah, we're cool. Me?

[01:38:17] Jim Hoffman | It's a lot of founders doing founder led growth, but we're trying to go upstream to do more CMOs. And it I've had 60% of our business is consumer than the others b to b. Okay. Was that helpful? Was that miserable?

[01:38:31] Jim Hoffman | How'd that go? Alright. Cool. So the

[01:38:31] Craig Swanson | next thing I wanna get into

[01:38:31] Jim Hoffman | is traffic, but let's take a little a little break. How are we doing on time here? Let me see. Let's come back at 3 and go into traffic because traffic's the final one, and it's a lot. So get coffee, or whatever you need.

[01:38:54] Jim Hoffman | Alright. Where are we? Where are we? Where are we? Okay.

[01:38:56] Jim Hoffman | So we're at the final blocker.

[01:38:56] Craig Swanson | We're almost there. We've almost solved

[01:38:56] Jim Hoffman | all of our problems. We've talked about positioning. We've got that figured out. We know the how to talk to customers, why they care. We know what language to use.

[01:39:09] Jim Hoffman | Got it. Congratulations. Conversion. We now know how to activate people. We have our irresistible offer.

[01:39:21] Jim Hoffman | We know how to package it up with an activation offer. We went through some websites and in a friendly way gave, some opportunities to enhance them. Alright. Let's talk traffic. This is I put this at the end for a very specific reason.

[01:39:36] Jim Hoffman | 1, it's usually the problem people think they have that is not right. And then second, if you don't have these figured out, you're just gonna burn money. I know we've made this mistake. So that that is why it is last. So let's talk about do you have a traffic problem just to kind of recap?

[01:39:54] Jim Hoffman | First, do you have enough traffic to hit your goals? You're like, I'm a double the business. You're like, well, how are we gonna get there with the traffic? Right? Second, do you have diversified traffic?

[01:40:03] Jim Hoffman | So you're not dependent on any one channel. Anybody been rocked by dependency on a channel? Right? SEO updates, iOS update to Facebook, referrals, dry up, that diversification can be key. Right?

[01:40:17] Jim Hoffman | So do you have enough channel by source? Like, candidly, like, with our agency, we're trying to find 3 that are predictable and sustainable. With meat, it's getting 1 and then 2. And then finally, this is my favorite do you have a proven traffic lever that if you pull it today, it's game on, and you can double your business. Does he might have this lever?

[01:40:37] Jim Hoffman | Wait. Who's selling it? Yeah. This is something that whenever we work with, like, private equity firms and they have, like, big scale goals, it's it's something we try and think through. We're trying to find the lever as well.

[01:40:54] Jim Hoffman | Okay. So here's how we break through, the those questions. We are gonna do a little math today. How much growth can you afford with your business? We're gonna hit on the idea of unit economics.

[01:41:04] Jim Hoffman | Your, how much you can afford determines your options for traffic and for growth. And then this is where I, I'm a big fan of I don't know about you, but, like, I have a million to do list that where I do nothing, but if I calendar it, it gets done. So we've applied this to growth. So we call it the growth calendar. Very original idea.

[01:41:27] Jim Hoffman | On calendaring out your growth. So I'll give you the example of what we're doing, and then we'll do a fun exercise, at the end, how to double your business in 10 minutes. So, yeah, that'll be easy. So stay around for that one. Okay.

[01:41:40] Jim Hoffman | Unit Economics, know your numbers, know what game you're playing. So, this

[01:41:45] Craig Swanson | is the math portion of of the workshop, but I'm gonna keep

[01:41:45] Jim Hoffman | it super simple, on how we're thinking about this. So whenever you're about to grow, we'll keep it very simple. The first question is like, okay, how much can I afford to spend to acquire a new customer? Customer acquisition costs, CAC, however we wanna call it. The second thing is how much money am I gonna make from this customer client over insert time frame?

[01:42:08] Jim Hoffman | Do I need to make money from them immediately immediately? Is it 90 days or is it 1 year? What's your lifetime value? I will show you with growth in a need, how we think about payback time or lifetime value. And then this one's big.

[01:42:25] Jim Hoffman | What's your churn rate or your repeat purchase rate? So why why do I care about this? I need to know what game I'm in as a business model. Am I in the acquisition game where I've always gotta fill the funnel to grow and get new customers? I'm selling diamond rings, right?

[01:42:38] Jim Hoffman | I gotta always find new people, or am I in the retention game where I close someone and I have them for live. I sell insurance. I sell subscription diapers. Right? Like, I'm a accountant doing accounting, services.

[01:42:54] Jim Hoffman | So these three things are our key. Alright. So I'm gonna show you, we're not gonna go into, like, oh, here's how you calculate CAC and LTV. I'm gonna show you how to think about what number is right for you. I'm gonna do 2 quick examples.

[01:43:08] Jim Hoffman | An e commerce company and

[01:43:09] Craig Swanson | then a b to b company. So e commerce, let's

[01:43:10] Jim Hoffman | say you sell a t shirt for $40 hypothetically, And let's say it costs around 10 bucks to make it. So I got 30 bucks that I can do something with. So I need to ask myself, how much am I willing to spend to acquire a new customer? And I'm calling this to take say, oh, I need 5 bucks on that first purchase to buy more inventory or to pay for software costs,

[01:43:34] Craig Swanson | whatever that could be. So now I'm willing on this, sell of one purchase to spend 25

[01:43:34] Jim Hoffman | bucks to acquire a customer. If anybody's run ads on, Instagram, Facebook, metadata lately, you know,

[01:43:47] Craig Swanson | that's a tough game to play to scale. So what I care about with need is increasing the average order value, getting the bundles

[01:43:47] Jim Hoffman | up, 115 bucks are gross margin percentage goes down, but notice how these numbers go up. And let's say we hold with the I'm I'm sorry. I'm blocking the light. I'm a horrible presenter. All of a sudden, the CAC ceiling goes from 25 bucks to $70 on that first purchase because I'm selling bundles.

[01:44:14] Craig Swanson | That's transformative for a business model because I can scale ads where the the most I

[01:44:14] Jim Hoffman | can spend on a customer goes from 25 to 70. And this is assuming I'm not trying to lose, money on the first purchase.

[01:44:29] Craig Swanson | So this number guides all the growth options I'm about to show you that you can do. So how much

[01:44:29] Jim Hoffman | can you afford, right? Does that make sense? I think we all get that. Let me know if you're like, Jim, we get it. That's obvious.

[01:44:43] Jim Hoffman | Okay. So that's why price matters. The second thing, payback time. So the question to ask yourself is you're about to invest in growth how long are you willing to make to wait to make money and to make a profit? So let's say you have an agency and let's say your average retainer is $7.

[01:45:03] Jim Hoffman | And after you pay your people, here's how much money you make. And let's say here's your take. I've gotta pay, I don't know, insurance, accounting, software, whatever that is. Here's your CAC ceiling on working with the client for 1 month. It's $2.

[01:45:16] Jim Hoffman | So I'm like, alright. I'll spend $2 to acquire a customer. But let's say you have a killer service based business or software product where your lifetime value is measured in years, not months, you're like, hey, I'm willing to pay up to 6 months of payback time to get a customer. I'll go a full year. All of a sudden, I'm going from spending $2 to get a customer to get I'll spend $24 to get a customer.

[01:45:39] Jim Hoffman | Like, that changes what we can do with our go to market strategy. So the math segment is done. Hopefully that makes sense. Your price, your payback time, have a huge impact in thinking how you acquire customers. Okay.

[01:45:55] Jim Hoffman | Any comments on that? Was that pretty straightforward? Okay. Alright. So, yeah, go for it.

[01:46:01] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | Oh, yeah, please. So now you're a services business and you don't have the you don't have the the similar direct

[01:46:11] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | unit costs, how do you how do you apply this to that? I mean, and our our table is talking about some of our average transaction prices, which could make the ad

[01:46:20] Craig Swanson | spend be astronomical if you could just

[01:46:20] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | purchase one customer. So how do you think about this So how do you think about you unit economics when you're a service based business and it's not a product based business and you don't have those direct costs? I mean, so real data, our our average project is a $100,000. So should I just go spend a shit ton of money on Facebook to get one customer? That's a technical question, obviously.

[01:46:48] Jim Hoffman | Because this is true. This is truly the service based example, where say you're I'll go over here. You're making a $100,000. And is that, like, maybe an annual deal, or it could be, like, 6 months? Maybe it doesn't matter.

[01:47:00] Jim Hoffman | So you're make it you're making a 100 k. So your people cost you half of that. So you have 50 k of, like, gross margin. So then the question is, of that, how much are you willing to spend? And here's the thing though, like, if you know, if you get a foot in the door with one project, you're great at land and expand, you could be super aggressive, or you're like, no, we've gotta be profitable on those because we don't know if the retention's there, then I would be a little bit less aggressive.

[01:47:26] Jim Hoffman | Because one agency I'm super jealous of, they have this model, they'll close one apartment complex, and then they'll get into the parent, and they land and expand like crazy. And so they're down to be very aggressive on what they'll do to get that, the foot in the door. Yeah. Jim?

[01:47:43] Craig Swanson | Jim? Craig over here. I just had a question for there might be a case state. You know what the answer is, but Can you think of any clients you've worked with or examples you have, right, they've really super high CAC and is working for them business. It's just for people that have, like, expensive service businesses.

[01:47:57] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. Well, actually, you actually made me think of one private equity company that was launching a supplement company where they're like, We don't care to make money on the first 5000 customers. They're like, we will do, like, 3 months of, like, what it would take that we would lose on them. So when you have those parameters, verse, I work with a bootstrap startup selling, evening gowns, They're like, we need to be 20 percent profitable

[01:48:22] Craig Swanson | on that. Another one is, that I'm thinking through. They have a really

[01:48:23] Jim Hoffman | impressive enterprise software product and the HR service, amazing retention, Not only do we spend a lot to acquire a customer, we've built free tools and products, to get

[01:48:38] Craig Swanson | them in the door, give

[01:48:38] Jim Hoffman | them this free offering, and then we kick them to sales. But again, all because Yeah. Enterprise SaaS, it's it's really nice when they stay around for years. Damn. Okay.

[01:48:53] Jim Hoffman | So we know our numbers. I'm like, alright. Got it, Jim. I know how much to spend. I know how long it's gonna take.

[01:48:58] Jim Hoffman | Show me my options. So here's your Denny's menu, of your growth options. And I put them into 2 simple categories. First, we'll call it boot shot growth ideas. You're like, Hey, Jim.

[01:49:09] Jim Hoffman | I need to be profitable. Let's pump the brakes on being super aggressive. Here are your options in this column here.

[01:49:14] Craig Swanson | If you have the benefit of a great P and L funding or amazing margins or payback time, here's some of

[01:49:14] Jim Hoffman | the, the options you have at your disposal. So something to think through. We're about to get into the growth calendar, and I want you to think through which ones of these should you slot in? Which ones are the money makers? Which ones should you experiment with?

[01:49:37] Jim Hoffman | And so I I can go through these. I put them all there, but, like, obviously, like, no budget. You're being scrappy. You're doing content marketing. If you can put together SEO yourself, you're doing that.

[01:49:45] Jim Hoffman | You're building a community. You're doing giveaways. You're working on partnerships and integrations. If we're doing paid, we're sponsoring the event. We're we're doing, you know, podcasts, sponsorships or obviously doing, like, anything with, Facebook, instagram, LinkedIn, TLA

[01:50:00] Craig Swanson | ads, all that

[01:50:00] Jim Hoffman | good stuff. But here's why it matters. You know your budget. You know your options. And then here's the big question.

[01:50:11] Craig Swanson | What is your go to

[01:50:11] Jim Hoffman | market strategy to get you

[01:50:11] Craig Swanson | to that next level? If it's hitting 7 figures or 8 figures, what is it? And

[01:50:14] Jim Hoffman | so Let me lay out these companies that based on their budget, based on their options, decided their go to market strategy. So what's that tip of the spear growth channel that will get you where you wanna go? So here here we go. Here are your options. You have product led growth.

[01:50:37] Jim Hoffman | So slack, you start to use slack. You're like, hey. I like the product. Let me invite my team. So your product is your growth engine, Dropbox, another example.

[01:50:48] Jim Hoffman | Founder led growth. The team at Basecamp, the founders are very well known, have an amazing blog. People sign up for Basecamp because of that. Spanks Sarah Blakely was just boots on the ground, wheeling that into existence, and then eventually pay it. If you're something, maybe, Derek, kind of, in your category where you could do, like, sales, it could be sales led growth.

[01:51:09] Jim Hoffman | There's, like, one private equity firm. They're, like, I wanna find a business model where I can just mobilize 200 salespeople to take market share because they really know how to do sales led growth. You have account based marketing, ABM. That's where sales and marketing works together, but it's this way. If you have a client that can pay you over a $150,000 per year, you can afford ABM.

[01:51:36] Jim Hoffman | So you can basically make a spreadsheet into, like, here are the 250 clients we wanna go after, and you basically do a custom bottoms up campaign with them. My buddy, Rob, is the CMO at Varonis. They do cyber security, software. Their average close times, like, 18 to 24 months. They'll send food trucks to companies, to get them, to be aware of their cybersecurity, product.

[01:52:01] Jim Hoffman | Let's go to paid growth. This is what we're trying to do with neat. True Classic is a $100,000,000 t shirt company because they are black belt at Facebook, and, Instagram ads. Organic growth, NerdWallet, honest company, two companies that are black belt at, search engine optimization, and getting free traffic. And then finally, If you get Kylie Jenner, go for it.

[01:52:24] Jim Hoffman | Let's do some influencer led growth. It's just so much easier. Give up the equity. Just do it. So those are the options.

[01:52:32] Jim Hoffman | So you guys figured out what you wanna do. Right? You have your go to market strategy. We all good. Alright.

[01:52:36] Jim Hoffman | I will show you the one for neat. Here we go. Okay. So this is what we're doing for neat. It is a 100% paid is what we're going for as the primary channel, and then we're bolting on organic and then eventually partner channels, but it's in this order, order.

[01:52:51] Jim Hoffman | We are trying this. We're trying to be, like, girlfriend collective, but I'm not banking on it, but it all starts with the offer and how it fits into our distribution channel for growth options. And then it's all about, literally, a website and a product page to activate, and then we have other things going on. So I know this is a lot to to read and process, but you kinda get a feel for our go to market strategy. So, you wanna see the one for growth hit that we're in?

[01:53:17] Jim Hoffman | I'll show you, but then I have to kill you. I do not have that one up here. That was a joke, fell flat. I'll try next time. No, candidly with growth hit, unfortunately, for better or worse, it's it's founder led growth I'm trying to get it to be more here.

[01:53:33] Jim Hoffman | It's been really hard to break out of it. I think a lot of, speed to be service owners can relate. You kind of become the the sales and marketing engine for better or worse. Okay. So this is the main event of the traffic section, and it's building your growth calendar.

[01:53:49] Jim Hoffman | So you're like, okay. You know your numbers. You know your options. What do we do next? Where how do we put this into action?

[01:53:56] Jim Hoffman | So I want you to think through, it is the start of September. We we've got 4 months left. And then all of next year, what are you doing in the next 4 to 6 months to calendar out your growth? So I'm gonna break down your growth calendar and and how you should factor that in. So with your growth, so I apologize.

[01:54:15] Jim Hoffman | This is so hard to read. But let me explain to you what this means. So this is your calendar. Let's say this is September, and then it goes till next September. We are calendaring out all the actions we are doing to hit our growth goals and think of your actions in in 2 simple categories.

[01:54:33] Jim Hoffman | 1, always on. When we think of our go to market strategy, like with me, my ads are always on, with with growth hit, like, what we're doing with sales is always on. So you're always on channels. These are things that are like the pillars for driving your your your, your leads are your sales. Here's the big one.

[01:54:53] Jim Hoffman | Your marketing moments or growth events throughout the year. How are you countering growth? So we we've worked with a bunch of, like startups that raise money, and the founders that impressed me the most They're just always making noise for their business. They're like doing a partnership. They're doing a deal.

[01:55:11] Jim Hoffman | They're doing an offline event. They're doing speaking. They're testing this channel. They're just making noise every single month or quarter to to hit their goals and will it into existence. So ask yourself, what are your always on channels, and what are you doing over the next 4 months to to drive business to help to hit those goals?

[01:55:30] Jim Hoffman | So let me break that down some options of what you could do there. So I I put this in the handout. Here's some of your always on options. Like, we're always running paid. We're always doing SEO focused content.

[01:55:41] Jim Hoffman | We're always, like, testing a referral campaign, or we have a community that we're always engaging with. We're always doing cold email. Those are things where you just have a team that's just testing and iterating. And then as you think of your marketing moments, how are you calendaring out what you're doing? How many launches do you do a year?

[01:56:00] Jim Hoffman | How many events are you attending? How many events are you sponsoring? Right? How many partnerships are you doing? How many tools, free tools are you building in a year, to to build up demand?

[01:56:12] Jim Hoffman | You know, lots of things you could do here. You guys have the list.

[01:56:16] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | Okay. Are 2

[01:56:18] Jim Hoffman | of the growth calendar. We are gonna combine the numbers with your

[01:56:21] Craig Swanson | growth options. So this is another example of what we do. We take everything

[01:56:21] Jim Hoffman | we're doing with our options, like Google Ads, social ads, cold email, I put a budget to it, and I'm putting assumptions on what are we gonna hit? Guess what? They're usually wrong, but they're kind of in a ballpark so I can get towards my goal. So let me give you two tips as you calendar out your growth always on channels, you calendar out your marketing moments. I want you

[01:56:47] Craig Swanson | to think of 2 things. Are you putting something on your growth

[01:56:47] Jim Hoffman | calendar that is trackable where it will drive clear ROI it'll drive clear, cost, or, booked meetings, whatever that is. If it is, I want you to put some assumptions there. Then the second thing is, how long will you give this test to cook? So many times, and I've been guilty of this. We'll stand up something.

[01:57:12] Jim Hoffman | And right away, it doesn't work. I'm like, well, cold email doesn't work for us or LinkedIn ads don't work for us. Give yourself some leeway to learn. And before you start an sparence. I'm gonna give this a year.

[01:57:24] Jim Hoffman | I'm gonna give this 6 months. I'm gonna give it 3 months. So for example, we're testing cold email and growth it with this AI tool. I'm giving it 4 months, and I told them when we sign the contract, we're testing a content marketing person. I'm giving him 12 months.

[01:57:37] Jim Hoffman | We're testing TikTok shop ads on neat. We're giving that 6 months. And I budget that, like, I know I'm probably not gonna have a good ROI, until, like, this point because, I've been too quick to cut things when they didn't get enough light of day. Then here's my hot take for the day. Not everything needs to be trackable.

[01:57:56] Jim Hoffman | It's funny. The more and more I do this stuff, the more I'm just like, man, attribution's so hard, and it's it's okay to have a percent of your budget where we're like, we're just gonna try that thing. We're gonna sponsor that event. I'm gonna fly my team to that thing. I'm gonna do whatever.

[01:58:13] Jim Hoffman | Be in aware of how much you're putting on these things, but we've had so many things that happened from these one off things where I didn't see ROI for 2 years that it's it's okay to do that. Okay. And then as you, like, get your growth calendar, the this is super simple stuff, but I'm gonna show with the BB company. So, like, with growth hit, like, right now, like, if we get 20 meetings per month to hit my goal of, like, doubling the business, I need to get 35 meetings per month. So that means and this is assumption on, like, our close rate and how much it costs to get a deal.

[01:58:48] Jim Hoffman | If I'm gonna hit my growth goals, where are these fifteen meetings coming from? So my growth calendar needs to align with hitting this goal in 6 months. So first, am I gonna spend basically $7 because that's how much it costs for a lead And if I max out on my ad campaign, where are these other leads coming from? Cause this is something we're going through right now. We're hitting a wall on paid with getting leads.

[01:59:12] Jim Hoffman | So, like, oh, gotta find another channel. And then let me show you, on the the DTC side, this is a client where we're scaling, basically from ad spend of, like, $4 per day to 34,000 per day. And they're like, when are we gonna see these inflection points? So we're like, calendaring out. Okay.

[01:59:31] Jim Hoffman | Here's the expected ROI and and here here's how we're going about it. So this is all very simple math, but just connecting your growth options and how they fit in your calendar and just put simple numbers to it. It it really makes you think differently on how you experiment and and what you expect with actually hitting your goals. Okay. Does it does that make sense?

[01:59:53] Jim Hoffman | Any comments because I have one last thing on the growth calendar, but are we good so far? Yeah. Go for it. Yeah. That that's a really good and, like, a little bit nuance question.

[02:00:14] Jim Hoffman | First money is a big part of it. The other thing is, like, if it's SEO, we're not gonna see results in 8 weeks. That'd be unfair. That's a more of a long term play. So it is getting somewhat educated on the tactic you're testing, whether it's talking to the vendor you're working with or to other colleagues to to give it the right space to to cook, if that's helpful.

[02:00:35] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. Yeah. Less to try

[02:00:50] Unnamed Speaker (Cybersecurity) | and tackle the more than

[02:00:51] Jim Hoffman | one, strategy or the more than one plan there. Yeah. So hitting on this go to market strategy, yeah. So a lot of time, it depends on the business. Like, we've seen people go to eight figures or to their B round of funding on the back of one channel.

[02:01:08] Jim Hoffman | Lots of times, I see we see people diversify too soon at at a big scale. However, I see it as one of these as your primary, but then you're probably bolting on another one. And it could vary by business line by segment, by persona. But but yeah. And and that's and it's even like you could have a primary go to market strategy, but then you're bolting on stuff just to be more diversified.

[02:01:32] Jim Hoffman | Okay. So where is it? Where is Bruceley? There he is. Okay.

[02:01:38] Jim Hoffman | Alright. So final 2 components. Like, I Jim got it. How much does spend on somebody? Here are my options.

[02:01:45] Jim Hoffman | Let me put into a growth calendar. Okay. I'm gonna do it. For the next 4 months, I'm gonna calendar out all my actions. I want you to think of 2 things so you can get your black belt in in growth marketing.

[02:01:57] Jim Hoffman | The first one is seasonality. Right? When is it peak season? When is it trough season? When is it demand capture time?

[02:02:06] Jim Hoffman | When is it demand creation time? Okay. So, for example, if we're selling, I actually I'll go to this example real quick. So I love this, this graph right here. So let's we'll go e commerce for a second.

[02:02:21] Jim Hoffman | You're an e commerce business where your peak season is spring to summer. Right? So you're selling t shirts. Q one's not good. Q three's not good.

[02:02:32] Jim Hoffman | So and I know q Four is gonna be good because of gifting. So I know my peaks and I know my troughs. So what do you do? How does your growth calendar align with this? So in the peaks, it's about demand capture.

[02:02:44] Jim Hoffman | I wanna be black belt with my ads. I wanna be amazing with my landing pages. I wanna have enough inventory. I wanna be ready to go. But what about these troughs?

[02:02:53] Jim Hoffman | Do we just, like, turn off the lights and and go on vacation? This is where it's about making noise. It's like, okay, I'm gonna be strategic to launch a new product here and here. I'm gonna do our collaboration here. I'm gonna launch that tool.

[02:03:07] Jim Hoffman | I'm gonna build a wait list. That way, you minimize the trough so you can maximize the peaks. So really think through the seasonality, and how that impacts your calendar. I think this is obvious, but just wanna do that. This is actually called the the 4 peaks method where usually businesses have natural 2 peaks and how can you engineer 2 other peaks?

[02:03:29] Jim Hoffman | Alright. Okay. So the final thing to get your black belt

[02:03:32] Craig Swanson | is factor in your persona. So we talked about early adopters,

[02:03:32] Jim Hoffman | fast followers, the masses, the informed, the afflicted, the oblivious, Which persona gets you to your growth goal and how are you going after them? Because with that growth calendar, we're not marketing to the same people with every action we're doing. There could be a campaign that's more bottom of the funnel. There could be a campaign that's more top of funnel. And so I wanna show this graph

[02:04:01] Craig Swanson | here. So these are all the different marketing tactics you could do based on how educated

[02:04:02] Jim Hoffman | somebody is. So if you look at your growth calendar, ask yourself, wait, man, our stuff's way too focused on bottom of the funnel. Like, growth hit, we were so guilty. We're like, we're so good at capturing people to go to Google. They're like, I need a growth marketing agency named growth hit.

[02:04:22] Jim Hoffman | It's like, yeah. We're very good at that. Let's stop over optimizing that. How do we get people that, you know, are just starting to learn about growth marketing or have a conversion problem, knowing that it's gonna take a longer time to close them. So that's another thing to factor in.

[02:04:38] Jim Hoffman | So this is basically showing different tactics you could do, based on where your customer is in their decision journey. So just to put a a bow on that,

[02:04:49] Craig Swanson | to be black belt, factor in your peaks in

[02:04:49] Jim Hoffman | valleys, factor in your customer intent. Alright. So was that a lot? Was that too much on the traffic side? Are we good?

[02:04:59] Jim Hoffman | Okay. So know your numbers, know your options, build your calendar, and then this one's coming in a second. So I'm gonna go through a couple quick examples of traffic of companies that found different accelerators, to kinda get their

[02:05:15] Craig Swanson | business moving along. So, I put HubSpot up here just

[02:05:15] Jim Hoffman | because they're really strong at diversified traffic channels, They launched on the back of engineering as marketing, building a free site grader, also with events. They then started buying podcast companies, being really good at content marketing, and then they're really good at paid and very good at SEO. Obviously, they're very good at marketing. This is car Edge. This is a car, shopping platform that is in a very competitive space.

[02:05:45] Jim Hoffman | They found a unique channel because it's like a father, son duo, actually launched a YouTube channel. He's like a used car salesman of 40 years. He's a he's a tech bro. It's actually really funny content. They're approaching, I think, 700,000 subscribers, but it's, really creative how that was our new channel where traditionally you're competing in SEO and paid.

[02:06:06] Jim Hoffman | Our B2B, which I mentioned, they're going top of the funnel, catching people that are getting into B2B marketing, They have a course. They have a podcast educating people on, like, B2B marketing with their academy, which is really nice. Again, another competitive space. Honest company, They got all on the map because they were black belt at, organic lead growth with SEO. And then this is one of our clients that this is a fun one.

[02:06:36] Jim Hoffman | They were able to go from 7 figures to 8 figures. By translating their website and having distribution in other countries. Their travel pillow, that was in, obviously, the US, but then we were able to go French, German, and Dutch. Because it's like we were kinda limited on the TAM to, to addressable market in the US and go beyond that. This is how we are gonna try and do with neat, but fulfillment is hard.

[02:07:00] Jim Hoffman | So we'll see when that happens. So I'll show you the fails and things we've tried with growth hitting neat. So it's growth hit, like a lot of service businesses, it's referrals. We're testing building our email newsletter. That's like 15,000.

[02:07:15] Jim Hoffman | We're testing ads on clutch and getting more reviews there. Ted or miss. We're testing partnerships with some of our, our, tools that we use. And then what really works well for us is, like, ads and landing pages. But I'm trying to diversify outside of referrals and paid to get one of these to to really hit to go the next level.

[02:07:35] Jim Hoffman | And then I kinda mentioned with neat, it's being really strong at ads, and then email should be making up 20% of sales. And we're just now investing into SEO, and that is for our informed persona. People have hyperhidrosis and real sweat issues, They have really good intent. I'm not trying to do SEO for, like, the best shirt to wear to Coachella. You know, we we can't win in that.

[02:07:58] Jim Hoffman | Okay. So I want to go we've got about 20 more minutes. I wanna hit on something before I get to this exercise. Okay. So first, let's recap, like, on what's blocking growth.

[02:08:10] Jim Hoffman | First, you did it. We've conquered all three, right, traffic, positioning, conversion, That is a lie. This is business. This shit's hard. It only gets harder.

[02:08:24] Jim Hoffman | There is one more blocker we have not talked about. Wait. Here it is. There it is. But wait.

[02:08:30] Jim Hoffman | There's more. It's fulfillment. You start growing and it works and you're like, oh, crap. We're out of inventory. Or, man, I don't have the people to fulfill this or our products can't handle this demand.

[02:08:41] Jim Hoffman | Right? So so how do you handle fulfillment? Or how do you even know you have that issue? Like, with these growth goals we laid out, Are you able to hit them? It's like I can get the traffic.

[02:08:50] Jim Hoffman | I can convert them, but can you actually fulfill? Do you have the inventory or the bandwidth? Another thing is as you start to grow and have growing pains, like, do you have churn issues, or are people returning the product? Are they not happy? So this is another true thing with growth.

[02:09:05] Jim Hoffman | Like, growth is not easy, and it's not cheap. So a lot of times, this is something you need to factor in. Are your growth goals realistic on what you can pull off? So here's the framework I have for fulfillment. Yeah.

[02:09:17] Jim Hoffman | So we're still trying to figure it out, but I'll show you some things we're trying to do with need. We sold out the product. That was great, but then we have no product. So we're trying to make pre orders work. Right?

[02:09:26] Jim Hoffman | We're playing up scarcity and FOMO. It's still working. We can run the ads, but the efficiency isn't there. So with my CAC ceiling, I have to be, hey, am I comfortable with that? With growth hit, when we run into bandwidth issues, we'll do, like, free roadmaps and asynchronous work until we can train and staff up, or we'll sell products and e courses.

[02:09:47] Jim Hoffman | So again, I don't have the solution. I'm not saying this stuff works, but something to think about with your growth goals, can you fulfill on it? Because I'm, I'm very cost conscious as a business owner. So investing in growth, this is when I I get a little nervous. But I do wanna leave you with one kind of exercise and framework that has really helped me as I'm trying to grow, and it's doubling your business in 10 minutes.

[02:10:10] Jim Hoffman | So I, as I think through like, my where I should spend my time as a business owner, like, a lot of you is, like, where can you have the biggest impact on the company? I get so into the weeds sometimes. I'm like, man, what am I doing? So I've tried to force myself, what are my bottlenecks or my high impact levers that if I can unlock those or pull those, it could be transformative. And so the key is identifying what are those levers, where if you just did a little dial of the knob, could be huge for your business.

[02:10:41] Jim Hoffman | So I listed out these levers on, like, what are the ones you could pull that could be huge for your business? So let me go through this right now. So one is ad copy and ad creative. I'll get there an example with that before, like, a consumer company doing this right could be huge. Pricing.

[02:10:56] Jim Hoffman | Obviously, let's double our prices. We'll double our revenue. That was easy. Offers. We we talked about this a lot.

[02:11:02] Jim Hoffman | This is a big one. Partner channels. I am so envious. There's this another agency that has a partner with an amazing SAS platform. Where the SaaS tool just sends them people that wanna use their product.

[02:11:13] Jim Hoffman | They get, like, 5 new deals a month from that partnership. And I'm like, can I can I have a little bit of that? Referral strategy. We mentioned girlfriend collective, turning customers into marketers, And then some other ones here, outbound automation, media buying, platform retention, I'll get into those. But before you do this exercise, I'm gonna ask you how you can double your business and 10 minutes.

[02:11:37] Jim Hoffman | Let me show you the hall of fame of people that have doubled their business in 10 minutes by using one of these levers. Okay. Here we go. Hall of fame. First one, this is hotmail.

[02:11:49] Jim Hoffman | Right? Got acquired for 500 or half a billion from Microsoft in

[02:11:54] Craig Swanson | 18 months on the back of this one move. This is before, like, Gmail was a thing in

[02:11:54] Jim Hoffman | web based email. They launched their, like, online email and no one's really using it. And they're like, ads aren't working. How do we do this? Literally at the bottom of every email, they just put PSI love you, get your free email from Hotmail, and it was gangbusters, right, turning customers into marketers with that simple referral mechanism.

[02:12:18] Jim Hoffman | The next example, Dollar Shave Club, we all know this one. We know that video. They're just selling subscription razors, but by investing in that video was transformative. This is my, Clire Brothers. They, run, ad campaigns.

[02:12:33] Jim Hoffman | They do stuff with, like, Jennifer Lawrence, like, huge brands. They have a really cool talk on tweaking ads and the impact it can have. Like, this is the same video. Everything's the same. They literally tweak this in this, no paid behind it.

[02:12:46] Jim Hoffman | This one's, like, 1,000,000 people reached. This one's 25,000,000 people reached. If you have a huge lever you could pull like that, it's like, are you investing the time and resources? Alright. We continue down the Hall of Fame Airbnb.

[02:13:00] Jim Hoffman | They were really stagnant for a long time. People were interested in making money from their homes. People were interested in, like, doing an alternative to hotels, but no one was staying there. Because of their conversion issues. It was all user generated content.

[02:13:14] Jim Hoffman | So they launch photography as a free product. Like, hey, you know, you're listing on Airbnb. We'll do a photo shoot of your your place for free. They launched in New York, and that was the catalyst. Every time they launched in a new market, it was percent of listings with new photography.

[02:13:30] Jim Hoffman | This is a Chrome extension, that a travel site did where, every time you open a new tab in Chrome, They show you somewhere in the world you can go. Like, oh, you could leave for Thailand in 4 hours. Click buy here to buy it. Don't put it on your browser super distracting. But this allowed them to compete with price line, right, in in big companies like that.

[02:13:52] Jim Hoffman | So And then I talked about the turtle 1. Oh, yeah. Let me show you the stuff we're trying to do that isn't isn't working. So with, neat, this one was obvious. We just raised the prices.

[02:14:01] Jim Hoffman | It's like, okay. We're gonna raise the shirt prices, and we're gonna sell bundles instead of shirts. It worked. But now I'm like, okay, what do I do next? I'm out of tricks.

[02:14:09] Jim Hoffman | So we're trying to figure that out. Though, yeah, the next thing we're trying to do is really invest in in ad creative. The other thing is we're we're gonna test global expansion to do our site in different languages. And then here's the one with growth hit that flopped we do a podcast and we're like, oh, let's repurpose it for YouTube and for TikTok. And it worked.

[02:14:28] Jim Hoffman | Like, this video got a million views. We got 25,000,000 views on this TikTok channel. Guess how many leads it drove? Yep. Yep.

[02:14:35] Jim Hoffman | About 0. About 0. But, hey, look at those views, guys. Look at those views. So we'll keep trying, but that one was the 1.

[02:14:41] Jim Hoffman | We were, like, so fired up, and then it was just crickets with the landing page for that one. But it's fun to see these signals that you keep testing and you keep learning. Okay. So in the final time we have here, I would love for you guys in your table to think through, how can you double your business in 10 minutes? What is that one lever you could pull?

[02:15:02] Jim Hoffman | So let's go for 10 minutes. And then in the last 5 minutes, I wanna hear everybody's secret I can steal them. Alright. Cool. Go ahead.

[02:15:10] Jim Hoffman | Hey. One thing, just to respect this, I know there's events technically supposed to end at 4. I'm sure people have other things to do. But, and I'll be saying a little bit after as well. And I know Craig will have some closing remarks, but I just wanted to open up.

[02:15:25] Jim Hoffman | Anybody wanna share some of the things they're thinking through on, ways to double your business in 10 minutes with some of these levers I'd love to learn from you guys, actually, on how you're thinking through it. Go for it.

[02:15:37] Traci Calderon (Atrium Kitchen) | My name is Tracy. I'm from the Atrium Kitchen, and something that I have not done since March 2023 is send an email newsletter. And for two and a half years

[02:15:49] Craig Swanson | during the pandemic, when we did a lot of fundraising to support our free meals

[02:15:49] Traci Calderon (Atrium Kitchen) | that we were doing, and anytime funds got low, I would send an email and we would refill the account. And in March of last year, I stopped doing it. So that is a 10

[02:16:07] Craig Swanson | minute quick fix to see what starts coming in. And if that's, like, email automation, that's that's game 1 too. If you could do a very, very good chair.

[02:16:07] Casey Cronk (First Security) | Thank you.

[02:16:19] Jim Hoffman | Anybody else? Go for it.

[02:16:19] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | So one thing that we do is with

[02:16:32] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | client referrals. Most of our business comes from real estate agents who all

[02:16:35] Craig Swanson | work close with each other. And we do get referrals, and we basically what we do is if someone refers us and that

[02:16:36] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | turns into a paying project, we give the original person referring us, like a staging gift certificate for 10% of whatever the other person spent. But we don't advertise this at all And I don't know if any for clients know about it. Bad about

[02:17:03] Craig Swanson | We're very bad about doing it. And what we do, not only we give 10% to

[02:17:04] Audience (Seattle Staged to Sell) | them, but we give 10% also off to the

[02:17:17] Shirin Sarikhani (Seattle Staged to Sell) | the new client who gets it,

[02:17:17] Craig Swanson | so it kinda creates this synergy. So, basically, it's working even when you do nothing. So if we do more of it,

[02:17:17] Unnamed Speaker (Med Spa) | it might work more

[02:17:29] Jim Hoffman | Hi, by the way, we see that all the time where we'll, like, unpack what people are doing. And we're like, oh my gosh. This is working. Like, can we try it once? We need to do more of it.

[02:17:36] Jim Hoffman | We're like, yeah. That's the thing. So many times, people try and diversify, and it's like, you can ride one channel or type to so much farther than you realize. So I think that's great. And I would push you to, like, don't ever complicate it, put a time on, like, how can we stand this up in 48 hours?

[02:17:51] Jim Hoffman | Let me send a text based email to my to the list and and try it. So, yeah, Carmen. Go ahead.

[02:17:58] Speaker 24: Yeah. So, Adrian's housekeeping. We have a house cleaning business and,

[02:18:03] Craig Swanson | 90% of our revenue is recurring. Like, our main

[02:18:03] Speaker 24: business is getting having people. But the goal is to get everybody on recurring schedule. And, in the last 6 months, we realized our conversion rate of to recurring is terrible even though our ratings stay, like, level, and we've been thinking a lot of it is, like, how our follow-up processes or sales is, but I think a lot of it now re rethinking is like our positioning at the very beginning, like, you know, maybe creating an offer at the beginning on our website, a compelling offer, like, you you know, 50% off your first service if you, you know, sign up for regular right away or something. Some some compel or, you know, the upgrade to a more premium first service if you sign up for regular you know, cancel any time, like, that kind of thing. We're thinking about something like super compelling that starts the conversation at recurring versus, like, have that as a later follow-up call to sales.

[02:19:05] Jim Hoffman | Can you start to educate them on it? I would even push you with you, like, reposition your offer How can you do that in the most, like, low level of effort way possible? It's, like, just, like, update the headline or a call to action. That that'd be amazing. Cool.

[02:19:26] Speaker 25: On Mihai, we have a electronic trading platform for bonds. So it's like a marketplace for mortgage bonds with the training with, big banks. And what I'm trying is partnering with some other marketplaces and other electronic trading platforms. The problem is that I have to think about is yeah, I need, like, 3 partners, one who brings the buyers, one who does the execution, want to guarantees for the trades. And I have to figure out, at which point do I actually make money out of it?

[02:20:00] Speaker 25: That says, how how do I pay everybody? And how much I want to invest in the growth to ignite electronic trading on our platform was you know, not making money and kinda losing.

[02:20:19] Jim Hoffman | Yeah. That's a good one. It's like partner channel could work, but figuring out your unit economics. Right? It's like, okay.

[02:20:24] Jim Hoffman | How much am I willing to give up on this? But that that could be an amazing unlock if it's partner or a platform that you're able to unlock. And we'll we'll do trials. Like, we have some other agencies that send us stuff where we'll, like, test different deals, but, mean, that's a honestly, that's one of my favorites. If you could do platform or partner, that's a big unlock.

[02:20:45] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | You've got me thinking about an offer we used to do, and I don't think we gave it enough time. And it both hit on the fulfillment component and trying to monetize relationships without it feeling scummy, which was, if if you referred somebody that we hired or you refer somebody that does business with us, we'd give, your referral field, we would also make a donation to a charity in your name. And it was kind of interesting to see how much pride people took when they not only were they the the the philanthropy get the money, but they knew a third party was doing it in somebody else's name. They just felt less dirty. And but I don't think we've given it enough time, and it kind of helps us on the fulfillment side because our challenge when we scale, then immediately becomes what you've alluded to is, like, having the right bodies to do the work.

[02:21:37] Derek Kalles (Kalles Group) | So.

[02:21:40] Jim Hoffman | And that makes it something they'd wanna talk about. You know? That's cool. Anybody else? Alright.

[02:21:50] Jim Hoffman | Cool. Well, Craig, we have 2 minutes, right, just under time.

[02:21:53] Craig Swanson | Should do you have

[02:21:54] Craig Swanson | do you have a closing thought, or should I hop up there, do my check?

[02:21:57] Jim Hoffman | No. I just, what do I have? Yeah. That was it.

[02:22:05] Craig Swanson | Alright. We get around our plot for Jim. Thank you very much.

[02:22:10] Jim Hoffman | Thank you.

[02:22:12] Craig Swanson | And, Jim, can you take it back to that list again? Cause I wanna hit 1. On referral strategy. So I just you have a whole bunch of business people here And I would like to hear from you. Can you describe when they're talking with other business owners, other people that they might refer to you?

[02:22:31] Craig Swanson | How do they know they are talking to someone that would be someone that you could really help grow their business? Use the mic so that they hear you.

[02:22:40] Wendy Kizzier (Northern Life) | Yeah. I

[02:22:40] Jim Hoffman | mean, if they need help with growth, and that could come in, like, their website, optimize it, building a website, or, like, they're standing up a funnel with with ads. They're looking to invest in it or or email, but, they're trying to kind of level up and whether they're looking to hire internally or get a agency or freelancer, even happy to just see if they're making the right move. We've even, help people make hires. But, yeah, that's

[02:23:03] Craig Swanson | is there any business?

[02:23:05] Jim Hoffman | We love ones that have room to scale, meaning, like, consumer's pretty obvious. And if it's B2B, can we have an impact on optimizing their website or potentially running ads? So I'm more sort of thinking, do our services align? But it's yeah, half our businesses like Shopifyecommerce, and the rest is, like, lead gen based businesses. Okay.

[02:23:24] Craig Swanson | And I

[02:23:25] Craig Swanson | just wanna make eye contact. Does everyone have an idea of, like, if you were into someone who you'd refer to, Jim? I'm not okay. We have some few thumbs up. Alright.

[02:23:33] Craig Swanson | So, Jim, thank you very much. That's been fantastic. Appreciate it. Don't worry. And we are done.

[02:23:41] Craig Swanson | I try to I try to keep to the 4 o'clock endpoint, but I did wanna mention one thing for all the EO members. We have had So we we've had a couple of people who are execs in this room that is people on your team that are key leaders. And I just wanna make you aware that there are special executive forums that you can have your team members go in to be part of. So they are part of E. O.

[02:24:05] Craig Swanson | And in fact, Sharon has has 2 people from her executive team that she is asking to get into the exec form now. So if you were not aware of it, you could either raise your hand or connect with Michelle and say, I've got someone I'm it in. And if you don't wanna know anything about it, you just wanna get the people in, you could email Lindsey. So just passing that along. And, thank you very much.

[02:24:27] Craig Swanson | There will be an email going out, I think, at 4, which has got links to the handouts that you guys got. It's got a, it's got a survey form. So I think we're including a link to the exec options. And, I would love your feedback about whether this is working, whether we should do, like, whether Columbia Tower Club's working for you. And I just really appreciate all your time.

[02:24:46] Craig Swanson | Thank you very much.
