Positioning:
This live coaching session is focused on helping SaaS companies improve user acquisition, activation, and retention by optimizing their website positioning. The course will teach participants how to communicate the value of their SaaS product more effectively and design their website to guide users through the conversion funnel, from sign-ups to active users.
Jim Huffman will lead SaaS leaders through actionable strategies to improve messaging, simplify the user journey, and create a website experience that resonates with potential users. By making small but impactful adjustments to their website’s positioning, SaaS companies can increase sign-ups, decrease churn, and drive long-term retention.

Pain Points to Address:
"Why are visitors not signing up for my free trial or demo?"
SaaS companies often generate traffic but struggle with user sign-ups because their website’s messaging is unclear or does not adequately communicate the product’s value.
"Why are users not activating after signing up?"
After initial sign-ups, many users fail to fully engage with the SaaS product. Poor website positioning may lead to an unclear onboarding process, causing users to drop off before experiencing the product’s full value.
"Why are my conversion rates so low despite strong traffic?"
SaaS companies with good traffic may still have low conversion rates due to confusing calls-to-action (CTAs), overly technical messaging, or a disorganized website layout that doesn’t guide users effectively.
"Why is my churn rate so high?"
Retaining users is critical for SaaS businesses, and poor website positioning can lead to a lack of clarity around the product’s long-term value. SaaS leaders need to learn how to reinforce the product’s value throughout the customer journey.
"How do I stand out in a saturated SaaS market?"
In a crowded market, SaaS companies need to differentiate themselves with a clear, compelling website that showcases their unique value proposition. Website positioning is key to standing out and convincing visitors to sign up and stick around.
