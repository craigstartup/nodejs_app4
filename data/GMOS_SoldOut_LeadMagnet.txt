   Why Isn’t Your Company Growing (like you want)?
    
   What’s Blocking Your Growth?
After working with 150+ brands, we have seen some flourish and some fail. Our agency (GrowthHit) has seen brands raise $100M, get on Shark Tank and sell for millions. We have also seen companies go out of business and fail.
In the cases of failure, these companies focused on growth when they were not ready. Sadly, If you’re not ready to grow then investing in growth will only accelerate your failure.
We hope this guide can help you prepare for growth or validate that you’re ready to grow.
Good luck,

  The 3 Blockers of Growth
Here are the three core blockers of growth:
1. POSITIONING: Do you have your positioning dialed in?
2. TRAFFIC: Do you have a scalable traffic channel that’s
been validated?
3. CONVERSION: Do you have a site can can convert a high
volume of traffic?
BONUS: The sneaky 4th blocker of growth is fulfillment because your supply cannot keep up with demand. As a growth team, we see this as a good problem to have!
      
  PART 1
Positioning Problem
In today's competitive market, having your positioning dialed in is crucial for growth. Without a clear point of differentiation, your company risks blending into the background. It's essential to win new customers and competitive deals/purchases because of what makes you unique. You want to be seen as a must-have, not just a nice-to-have. Tip: It’s not about being better. You can win by being different.
POSITIONING CHECKLIST:
❏ Do you get new customers (or win competitive deals) because of your point of differentiation?
❏ Can customers easily articulate your point of differentiation?
❏ Are you a nice-to-have or must have? (EX: You want to sell painkillers and not vitamins.)
       
  PART 2
Traffic Problem
Traffic is the lifeblood of your growth strategy, but not just any traffic will do. You need scalable, validated channels that consistently bring in the right visitors. Reliable traffic from diversified organic sources, paid campaigns, partner channels, referrals, and your email list can significantly impact your growth. Ensure your traffic strategy is robust and diverse to fuel your company's expansion.
TRAFFIC CHECKLIST:
❏ Do you have enough traffic to hit your growth goals?
❏ Do you have predictable organic traffic?
❏ Do you have quality traffic from paid?
❏ Do you get reliable traffic from partner channels
or referrals?
❏ Do you get consistent traffic from your email list?
        
  PART 3
Conversion Problem
Driving traffic to your site is only half the battle; converting that traffic into customers is where the real magic happens. A healthy conversion rate is essential for turning visitors into loyal customers. Your site needs to handle high traffic volumes and convert them efficiently. Focus on creating an activation offer that quickly turns leads into paying customers, ensuring your efforts yield a positive ROI.
CONVERSION CHECKLIST:
❏ Do you have a HEALTHY conversion rate?
❏ Do you have an activation offer that converts
people quickly?
❏ Are you converting customers in a ROI positive
way?
        
  BONUS
Fulfillment Problem
Ensuring you can meet demand is just as important as generating it. Your ability to fulfill orders or deliver services efficiently and effectively can make or break your growth strategy. It's crucial to have the necessary inventory or bandwidth to keep up with increased demand. Maintaining a positive return or churn rate is also essential, as it justifies scaling up. Effective fulfillment not only supports your growth but also reinforces your brand's reliability and customer satisfaction.
FULFILLMENT CHECKLIST:
❏ Can you fulfill on enough work to hit your goals?
❏ Do you have the inventory or bandwidth to fulfill
the necessary demand to hit your goals?
❏ Do you have a positive return rate or churn rate
to justify growth?
